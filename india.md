# **A) Context**

## **A1 Constitutional and Legal System**

India is a republic with a federal and written Constitution. It came into force on 26th January 1950\. Since India was under the rule of the British before acquiring independence on 15th August 1947, the bulk of the provisions of the present Constitution is influenced by the Government of India Act, 1935 with one major exception. The present Constitution has an entrenched bill of Rights which is known as fundamental rights. The fundamental rights are limitations on the exercise of the legislative power by Parliament and the executive power by the government, i.e., both Parliament and the Government are enjoined not to enact laws or take any action contrary to or in abridgement of the fundamental rights.[^1] However, the same is subject to certain exceptions, mainly Article 31(a) (b) and (c) empowering the government to provide immunity to certain laws against the entire Bill of Rights or to promote Directive Principles in Article 39 (b) and (c).[^2]

India is a densely populated country with more than 1.3 billion people. India has 28 States and 8 Union Territories. Following are the major differences between the States which are also known as provinces and the Union Territories. Every state/province in India is allocated legislative power under the 7th Schedule of the Constitution of India read with Article 246 (3), whereas the certain Union Territories being under the direct control of the Parliament and President of India do not have any legislative powers and are governed by the administrator appointed by the President and subject to laws enacted by the Parliament. While certain Union Territories like the National Capital Territory of Delhi[^3] and Pondicherry/Puducherry[^4] though vested with certain legislative powers, such legislative powers are not exercisable by them like states/provinces; rather, the same is to be overseen by the president. Although the distribution of powers between the Centre and the State/Provinces is governed by federal principle, the relationship between the Union Territories and the Central Government and the Parliament is almost that of the former being under the supervision of the latter i.e., the relationship is governed by the principles of a unitary government. In one respect, both union territories and provinces are similar in the sense that populations of both send the representatives to the Parliament based on the principle of adult franchise. Although most states/ provinces have equal constitutional status in terms of legislative and executive powers being the units of the federation, the same is not the case with Union Territories and each Union Territory is administered under a separate Constitutional regime and legislations as seen above. To say this does not mean that the Indian Constitution is federal in the classical sense (i.e., in the American sense). Even though the Constitution is federal, its inclination is towards a centralized power dynamic.

However, following the principles of federalism, there is a distribution of powers between the center, states/provinces, and local and self-Governments. Local and self-government mean cities, sub-cities, and villages to be administered by Municipal Corporations, Municipalities, and Panchayats. Municipalities stand in hierarchy to panchayats, the former being associated with cities and the latter with villages.[^5] The relationship between the local self-government and the state/province government is by way of devolution, i.e., the latter cannot exercise their powers allocated to them under Schedule 11 and 12 of the Constitution of India, directly without the executive and legislative support of the concerned State/ provinces. On the other hand, the Union Territories have their own Legislature or are governed by the administrator appointed by the President e.g., in the case of Ladakh, Chandigarh, and, Jammu and Kashmir. Since India has a federal government, its Constitution provides for an independent arbiter, i.e., the Supreme Court, for the interpretation of its written constitution which is deemed supreme. In case of conflicts pertaining to legislative competence on subject matters of laws, the decision of the Supreme Court is final. Unlike the US, none of the States/provinces has their own Constitution, but the Constitution of India has a flexible set up to adequately address the diversity of provinces inter-se. In some situations, these bodies have the power to make laws and deliver public services (i.e., devolved powers or matters), but the Indian Parliament and Government retain some powers across the whole of India (i.e., reserved powers or matters).[^6]

Broadly speaking, subject matters with local nature are allocated to the State/Provinces[^7], and under their guidance to the municipalities and panchayats[^8]. Matters which are not purely local or of national importance are enshrined in the concurrent list where both the Centre and States/Provinces can enact laws. However, in case of any conflict, the law enacted by the Centre prevails. In exceptional circumstances, conflicting laws enacted by the State/province may continue if the President provides assent to the same.[^9] Powers of national dimension are vested in the Parliament. Since matters like Human Rights and equality have both national and local dimensions, the Parliament has regulated this area predominately by directing the States/provinces to have in place appropriate machinery for its enforcement.[^10] So far as the subject of transportation, planning, and built-in environment is concerned on all the levels; national, State/Provinces, and local self-government level powers have been vested in authorities through legislations and codes.

In India predominantly, there is a common law model of the legal system. But in some pockets of the north-east and scheduled areas, a tribal legal system is prevalent. Unlike the UK, India has a written Constitution with a parliamentary government. We follow in India, the dualist paradigm in respect of interface of International law and Municipal law, i.e., international treaties ratified by the Indian government are not directly enforceable in domestic courts. They can, however, be taken into account as interpretive guides in cases where the law is unclear. In India, we follow the axiom of going for harmonious interpretation of International law and Municipal law, and in case of irreconcilable conflict between the two, primacy is given to the latter. This is in line with Article 51 of the Constitution of India, one of the directive principles of State Policy obligating the State to promote International Law.[^11]

When the international treaties are incorporated into domestic law through legislation, they then have the same effect as domestic law and can be enforced in the courts in line with the incorporating legislation. The relevant international agreements which have been incorporated into domestic law in India are – Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR), International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), International Covenant on Economic Social Cultural Rights (ICESCR), Convention on the Rights of Child (CRC), Convention on Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), United Nations Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD). In this connection Section 2(f) of Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993(hereinafter referred to as PHR Act) is relevant; which defines “_International Covenants” to mean the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on the 16th December 1996 and such other Covenant or Convention adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations as the Central Government may, by notification, specify_”.[^12]

Under Section 2 (d) of the PHR Act, human rights are defined as _“human rights” means the rights relating to life, liberty, equality and dignity of the individual guaranteed by the Constitution or embodied in the International Covenants and enforceable by courts in India_”.[^13] An interesting question that arises for consideration is whether the aforementioned definition of human rights is confined to the PHR Act or is it applicable across the board. According to a narrow view, the aforementioned definition is confined to the PHR Act and is not applicable beyond the national and state human rights commissions and special human rights courts established under this Act. Understood thus, this definition is a guidance for the assumption of the jurisdiction by the aforementioned bodies. However, if we look at the definition of human rights in 2(d) in terms of its language then there is no evidence to suggest that the definition be confined to only commissions and courts under this Act, expressively apart from referring to fundamental values like life, liberty, equality and dignity it also refers to International Human rights law standards and makes human rights guaranteed by the above to; the competence of the courts. In other words, by reading this definition broadly, the commissions and courts under this Act can be moved. However, which of the two interpretations is plausible, stands to debate and difference of opinion. However, it is possible to argue that the power to notify under Section 2 (f) is a delegated authority on the executive to make any international human law standard as a part of Indian legal order by issuing a notification. To date, the UNCRPD appears to have missed the cognizance of the executive under this section. Should it be implied from the same that the PHR Act does not guarantee the Human Rights of Persons with Disability (PWDs)? In our submission, it does guarantee their rights for the following reasons, first, rights relating to life, liberty, equality, and dignity of the individual guaranteed by the Constitution understood broadly would mean these rights guaranteed to even persons with disability. Second, since UNCRPD has been categorically ratified by the Parliament of India, rights guaranteed by the same are a part of the Indian legal order and hence courts have the competence to enforce such rights. Hence, overemphasis on notification by the executive under Section 2(f) of the PHR Act is unwarranted.

Apart from the PHR Act machinery, PWDs can also move the courts under Article 32 and 226 of the Constitution of India for redressal of violation of their fundamental rights against the state, public authorities, and even against private parties in some cases. This is so because most of the fundamental rights guaranteed in Part III of the Constitution of India are reiterated in the provisions of UNCRPD. In this connection, the following provisions of Part III of the Constitution of India, 1950 conferring fundamental rights on citizens, and in certain cases on non-citizens, deserve mention. Article 14 lays down “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India.”[^14]

Guarantee of equality of law and equal protection of law envisaged by this article is available both to citizens and non-citizens, in the light of the word ‘person’ in its text quoted above. In its relevant part, Article 15 of the Constitution of India, 1950 lays down

“(1) The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them.

(2) No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them, be subject to any disability, liability, restriction or condition with regard to—

(a) access to shops, public restaurants, hotels and places of public entertainment; or

(b) the use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads and places of public resort maintained wholly or partly out of State funds or dedicated to the use of the general public.

(3) Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any special provision for women and children.

(4) Nothing in this article or in clause (2) of Article 29 shall prevent the State from making any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes….”[^15]

Evidently, Article 15 (1) and (2) are non-discriminatory clauses prohibiting discrimination on certain grounds. However, the ground of physical and mental disability is conspicuously absent from both these clauses. However, by way of reverse reasoning and in the light of the categorical language of Article 14 seen above, the Indian judiciary has held in a number of judgments that discrimination on the ground of mental and physical disability is impermissible. Thus, in a landmark judgment, the Delhi High Court[^16] held “The Exclusionary clause of \`genetic disorders', in the insurance policy, is too broad, ambiguous and discriminatory \- hence violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India”[^17]

Implicit in this holding is the important doctrine that beyond the enumerated grounds of Article 15 qua non-discrimination, the judiciary can fall back on Article 14 to introduce new grounds of non-discrimination while deciding the reasonableness of classification between citizens inter se.

Article 19 is most relevant. Inter alia it guarantees, in its relevant part,

19\. Protection of certain rights regarding freedom of speech etc.

(1) All citizens shall have the right,……

(d) to move freely throughout the territory of India.

(e) to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India

Under Article 19 (5), the Parliament and State legislatures are empowered by enacting a law, to impose restriction on aforementioned freedom on the grounds of “in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe”[^18]

For the meaningful exercise of both these freedoms on part of PWDs, these freedoms have to be enabled in the light of principles of accessibility and universal design enunciated in the preamble of UNCRPD read with Articles 3 and 9\.

Since India has ratified the convention categorically in light of Articles 37[^19] and 51[^20] of the Constitution of India, obligating all the appropriate governments to foster respect for promotion of international law, it has to interpret all the laws as inform and all the institutions of governance by the aforementioned principles mandated by UNCRPD – as illustrated by the decision of the Supreme Court in Rajive Raturi v. Union of India.[^21]

Article 32 of the Constitution of India is worth noticing in its relevant part

“32. (1) The right to move the Supreme Court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by this Part is guaranteed”. In other words, any citizen/person depending upon the particular fundamental right can move the Supreme Court directly for redress against violation of fundamental rights. Article 226 of the Constitution of India confers the same remedy to all citizens and persons to move the High Court in whose jurisdiction they fall, for redress against violation of their fundamental rights. In other words, the Constitution has given a choice to citizens to opt for the appropriate forum amongst the high courts and the Supreme Court. As per the constitutional standards, it is not mandatory for citizens/persons to first move the high court as the jurisdiction of both forums under Articles 32 and 226 is concurrent. However, the usual practice is that citizens/persons must move concerned high court unless the cause of action has a national dimension. Again, so far as the right to move the Supreme Court or the High Courts is concerned, the principle of accessibility is pivotal. Can any PWDs move the aforementioned courts in absence of observance to the principle of accessibility? Since the answer to this question is a plain no, it can be categorically asserted that the right to accessibility is an enabler right to activate the enjoyment of all the fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution.

Reference must also be made to certain relevant Directive Principles of State Policy.

Article 41 of the Constitution of India reads “The State shall, within the limits of its economic capacity and development, make effective provision for securing the right to work, to education and to public assistance in cases of unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement, and in other cases of undeserved want”[^22]

Article 46 of the Constitution of India – which lays down one of the directive principles of State policy and is not enforceable directly in the court of law \- obligates the state to promote with special care, the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people, and, in particular, of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes and shall protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation. Before concluding this section, it is important to highlight two issues – the relationship of the Bill of Rights with the Constitution and the relationship of the Bill of Rights with the Directive Principles of State Policy. In respect of the former, it has to be said it is submitted that the Bill of Rights is a limitation on the exercise of power by both legislature and executive. Moreover, as a post-colonial state, these rights are looked at for nurturance of enlightened citizenship. In India, the nature of the Bill of Rights however is more or less communitarian. In other words, the exercise of the fundamental rights by any citizen is subject to, and in light of the sustenance of the community; we do not follow the absolute right model as all fundamental rights in India are subject to reasonable restrictions and interpretative limitations evolved by the courts. It has to be also noted that Article 32 (b) creates a special instrument i.e., 9th Schedule and if any law is inserted in this Schedule, then it is immune from the challenge of violation of fundamental rights in the courts. Even if the law is declared unconstitutional by the court on the ground of violation of certain fundamental rights, such law can still be sustained by Parliament if it is inserted in the 9th Schedule. However, the same ordinary legislative process cannot be followed. The process of amending the Constitution requiring a special majority under Article 368 is the key to the insertion of law in the 9th Schedule. Similarly, Article 31 (c)[^23] provides immunity to laws enacted by Parliament and the state/province legislature promoting Articles 39 (b)[^24] and (c). Finally, as per Article 359, Articles 20 and 21 are non-derogable absolutely, and even during the emergency, the Parliament cannot retract from the obligations arising out of the same.

So far as the relation between Directive Principles and Bill of Rights is concerned the former is not enforceable by law, whereas the latter can be vindicated by the citizens by moving either High Court under Article 226 or Supreme Court under Article 32\. Although the directives are not enforceable the Government cannot be oblivious to such principles under Article 37, the Parliament/ State/ Provincial legislation is obligated to take this principle into account while making laws. The article also explicitly provides that these principles are “fundamental in the governance of the country.”[^25] Initially, the view was that in case of conflict between directive and fundamental rights, the latter shall prevail. The judiciary has gradually come full circle and now the view is that Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles should not be read in opposition to one another. Rather their synthesis creates a balanced and more equal society. Thus, the courts are willing to harmonize fundamental rights and directive principles. At times, courts employed directives to determine the scope of a particular fundamental right or to measure the reasonableness of restriction imposed on the fundamental rights. Both the Chief Commissioner of PWDs, the Government of India, and the Commissioners of Disability in all the states have been granted powers to move the Indian Judiciary to redress the violations of fundamental rights of the PWDs in appropriate cases. In short, not only PWDs but even NGOs on their behalf and State and Chief Commissioner of PWDs have standing to move the courts to vindicate the Rights of PWDs.

Unlike UK, in India the enforcement of the UNCRPD is not dependent on or subject to the principle of subsidiarity. However, in sharp contrast with the UK which has also ratified the optional protocol to UNCRPD, there is potential for PWDs not only to move the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) but they can also knock on the doors of UNCRPD committee and raise a complaint against the Government of UK. Whereas PWDs in India are not able to move the UNCRPD committee’s individual complaint mechanism to redress the violation of Human Rights even if they are unhappy with the outcome of Indian Courts, as India has not ratified the optional protocol of UNCRPD. To this extent, the PWDs in the UK have an upper hand over their counterparts in India. However, when it comes to giving effect to the provisions of UNCRPD by Indian courts, the provisions of UNCRPD are mostly akin to fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III of our Constitution which courts are mandated to apply to their fullest extent. Understood thus, PWDs in India have much more robust domestic remedy compared to their British counter Part. We tend to compare the position of law in India with that of the UK mainly because the Indian legal order very heavily draws from the Common law legal system and parliamentary tradition of the UK.

## **A2 International Commitments**

### **A2.1 UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities**

Article 253 of the Constitution of India read with Article 73 (1) (b) regulates the regime of signing and ratification of International Treaties in India. Article 73 (1) (b) provides that

“_Subject to the provisions of this Constitution, the executive power of the Union shall extend [(a)](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1619608/) to the matters with respect to which Parliament has power to make laws; and_

[_(b)_](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/469957/)_ to the exercise of such rights, authority and jurisdiction as are exercisable_ by the government of India by virtue of any treaty on agreement”.

Article 253 provides that

“_Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this Chapter, Parliament has power to make any law for the whole or any part of the territory of India for implementing any treaty, agreement or convention with any other country or countries or any decision made at any international conference, association or other body_.”[^26]

Thus, Parliament is under an obligation to ratify and implement any treaty, agreement, or convention by incorporating it into the Indian legal order by enacting a law. The power to sign a treaty, agreement, or convention is vested with the executive under Article 73 referred to above. As seen above, by exercising its executive power under Article 73(1) (b), the Government of India signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities on 30 March 2007, and the Parliament ratified it on 1 October 2007 under Article 253\.

India has ratified UNCRPD categorically, i.e., unconditionally and without any reservations. India has not, however, either signed or ratified the Optional Protocol. So far as designation of National focal point under Article 33 of UNCRPD is concerned, before the enactment of RPWD Act, 2016, the Central Coordination Committee[^27] under the PWD Act, 1995 was obligated inter alia to perform; “_Review and coordinate the activities of all Departments of Government and other Governmental and Non-Governmental Organizations which are dealing with matters relating to persons with disabilities; Develop a national policy to address issues faced by persons with disabilities; Take such other steps to ensure barrier free environment in public places, work places, public utilities, schools and other institutions.”_

To render support to this committee there was Central Executive Committee. At the State level, the same machinery was replicated under PWD Act, 1995\. The Government of India had designated Chief Commissioner of Persons with Disabilities (Section 58 of PWD Act) at the Central Level and Commissioners of Persons with disabilities at the State level (Section 60 of PWD Act) to look into complaints, on his own motion or on the application of any aggrieved person or otherwise, with respect to matters relating to (a) Deprivation of rights of persons with disabilities; (b) Non-implementation of laws, rules, bye-laws, regulations, executive orders, guidelines or instructions made or issued by the appropriate Governments and the local authorities for the welfare and protection of rights of persons with disabilities, and take up the matter with the appropriate authorities (Section 62). With the enactment of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPWD Act) there is not much change in this machinery save as replacement of coordination Committees at Central and State Level with District Level Committees and change in the terminology of Central and State Executive Committees as Central and State Advisory Boards (RPWD Act). We submit that the functions of the advisory boards at the Central and State Level mirror the functions of Central and State Level Committees in the PWD Act, 1995\. Interestingly, the District Level Committee status has been elevated to the statutory level whereas, the institution of Central and State Coordination Committees have been done away with. It is not clear whether District level committees can be an effective substitute for Central and State Coordination Committees. Both Advisory Boards and Commissioner have the recommendatory/advisory mandate and the Act does not envisage any independent framework to protect, promote and monitor the implementation of the Convention. Of course, it is possible to contend that the National Human Rights Commission, the State Human Rights Commission, National and the State Commission for Women Constituted under the PHR Act, and National Commission of Women Act, 1990, National Commission for SC and ST (Article 338 and 338-A), National Commission for backward class (Article 342A) are some of the main redress mechanisms mandated to address the grievances of disabled and to promote and protect their interests. NHRC has also constituted a Core group on Disability and Elderly Persons to highlight the human rights of PWDs.

However, controversy erupted in respect of designating of National focal point under Article 33 of UNCRPD due to difference of opinion between the Government of India and the UNCRPD Committee. In its initial report submitted by the Government of India as a State party under Article 35 UNCRPD, the Government of India has, as a matter of fact, characterized and perceived the designated focal point very broadly. In its concluding observations, UNCRPD committee appears to have taken the view that the advisory boards constituted at the Central and State level is the designated focal point.

To allude to the report “_The PWDA along with the Constitution of India and other relevant laws is the existing vehicle of implementation’, The Central and State Coordination Committees are established by Sections 3 and 13 of PWDA respectively. The Central Coordination which is headed by the Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment, members “five persons, as far as practicable, being PwDs to represent NGO’s or associations which are concerned with PwDs”. These members are to be nominated by the Central Government and each member is required to represent a different disability. The Government is required to ensure that at least one of the members nominated, is a woman. The other members of the Committee are the Secretaries of other relevant Ministries; Directors of the National institutes; and representatives of the State and Union Territories. This Committee has been envisaged “to serve as the national focal point on disability matters and is required to facilitate the continuous evaluation of a comprehensive policy towards solving the problems faced by PwDs_”.[^28] Normatively, India has adopted a multi-axis approach to designate focal points for monitoring the implementation of UNCRPD. There is of course the issue of coordination of response, these focal points in absence of effective statutory machinery under RPWD Act 2016\.

It is, however, unjustified to conclude that India has not addressed the requirements of Article 33 of UNCRPD; there may be debates about the degree and width of powers of the various mechanisms envisaged as the focal points. In this connection, it is worthwhile to excerpt the relevant part of the annual report (2018-19) submitted by the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities.[^29]

**Vision**: “_To build an inclusive society in which equal opportunities are provided for growth and development of persons with disabilities so that they can lead productive, safe and dignified lives_.”

**Mission**: _“To empower persons with disabilities through its various Acts/Institutions/Organizations and schemes for rehabilitation and to create an enabling environment that provides such persons with equal opportunities, protection of their rights and enables them to participate as independent and productive members of society_.”

**Objectives:** _“To realize its vision and achieve the mission, the Department strives for the following objectives;_

1. _Physical rehabilitation, which includes early detection and intervention, counselling, medical rehabilitation and assistance in procuring appropriate aids and appliances for reducing the effect of disabilities._

2. _Educational rehabilitation including vocational education._

3. _Economic rehabilitation and social empowerment_

4. _Developing rehabilitation professionals/personnel_

_Improving internal efficiency/ responsiveness/ service delivery and Advocating empowerment of persons with disabilities through awareness generation among different sections of the society_.”

A closer look at the mandate of the Department reinforces our observation, a multi-access focal point. We tend to agree with the concluding observation of the UNCRPD committee about the absence of an independent mechanism for protecting, promoting, and monitoring the implementation of the Convention. There is also a lack of clarity about the relationship between the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities and the Commissioner’s Advisory Board under the RPWD Act. The Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities having been established by the Government, outside the Statutory framework of the RPWD Act, there are also issues about the hierarchy between the Secretary, Department of Disability Affairs, and the Chief Commissioner of PWDs. Moreover, there is a lack of uniformity when it comes to the functioning of similar departments at the state level. In none of the States/ provinces, RPWD Act having not been implemented in letter and spirit, in the absence of rules, and the creation of machinery, the regime is still regulated by the provisions of the 1995 Act.

A look at the Website of the Social Justice and Special Assistance Department, of Government of Maharashtra,[^30] shows that the Government of Maharashtra still routes the Commissioner of Disability’s authority under the PWD Act, 1995\.

There is some enhancement in the role of Commissioner under Section 80 of RPWD Act 2016.[^31] The relevant provision reads: “Section 80

1.  _identify, suo moto or otherwise, provision of any law or policy, programme and procedures, which are in consistent with this Act, and recommend necessary corrective steps;_

2.  _inquire, suo moto or otherwise deprivation of rights of persons with disabilities and safeguards available to them in respect of matters for which the State Government is the appropriate Government and take up the matter with appropriate authorities for corrective action;_

3.  _review the safeguards provided by or under this Act or any other law for the time being in force for the protection of rights of persons with disabilities and recommend measures for their effective implementation;_

4.  _review the factors that inhibit the enjoyment of rights of persons with disabilities and recommend appropriate remedial measures;_

5.  _undertake and promote research in the field of the rights of persons with disabilities_;

6.  _promote awareness of the rights of persons with disabilities and the safeguards available for their protection;_

7.  _monitor implementation of the provisions of this Act and schemes, programmes meant for persons with disabilities;_

8.  _monitor utilisation of funds disbursed by the State Government for the benefits of persons with disabilities; and_

9.  _perform such other functions as the State Government may assign”._

On the other hand, the state of Uttar Pradesh sounds more progressive with the establishment of the Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities Department separately from the State Level Commissioner; however, the language of welfare and assistance rather than rights still dominates the discourse in the states. It would be appropriate to quote from the concluding observations of the UNCRPD Committee;

**“_69\. The Committee recommends that the State party:_**

_(a) Take measures to strengthen the Central Advisory Board and the equivalent state bodies beyond an advisory role and ensure the coordination of focal points on disability, at all levels in the State party and in all sectors, for the effective implementation of the Convention;_

_(b) Ensure that the national and state human rights commissions are part of the independent monitoring framework under article 33 (2) of the Convention, providing technical, human and financial support to accomplish their mandates. The State party should take account of the Committee’s guidelines on independent monitoring frameworks and their participation in the work of the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD/C/1/Rev.1, annex) when designing the independent monitoring framework_

_(c) Ensure that persons with disabilities, through their representative organizations,_ effectively participate in monitoring of the implementation of the Convention.”[^32]

The Committee has appreciated India for providing accessible polling booths and has also cautioned against lack of coordination with Disabled Person’s Organisation vis-à-vis PWDs in situations of risk or caught in mass disaster etc.

It has also recommended, “(a) Implement sections 40–46 of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016, on accessibility, by taking a cross-sectoral approach, requiring all ministries engaged in public infrastructure to address accessibility in all planning and implementation processes with an appropriate time frame, budget, monitoring, and evaluation, to improve accessibility, especially in rural areas, and involving persons with disabilities through their representative organizations at every stage;

(b) Ensure that accessibility requirements are included in public procurement legislation and policies for goods and services, especially in the Bureau of Indian Standards Act at the national and state levels;

(c) Enforce the accessibility of transportation services, including transport concessions and licenses, and accessibility of information, and accelerate the implementation of the barrier-free buildings.”[^33]

### **A2.2 UN Sustainable Development Goals**

SDGs are a set of quantifiable objectives cutting across social, economic, and environmental dimensions to be achieved by nations by 2030\. In India at the national front, emphasis is laid on having common understanding and coordination, developing a monitoring system, and a reporting mechanism to respond to sustainable development goals. For this purpose, NITI Aayog along with the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), and other departments have been identified as key institutions to attain the objectives underlying SDGs. NITI Aayog is identified as an apex coordinating agency.[^34] “_India occupies a unique place among the nations of the world. It is a young sovereign state built on millennia of wisdom, culture and traditions. The seventh largest and the second most populous country is also the largest democracy_.”[^35] Being a State with a vast amount of diversity in terms of a variety of cultures and languages, India has always faced a challenge striking a delicate balance between nurturing diversity and maintenance and sustenance of Indian-ness as a whole to achieve this balance. Unity in diversity is our mantra. “_With diversity at its core, India is fast progressing on a journey that seeks prosperity and well-being for everyone from every culture and language, leaving no one behind. This is where India’s development philosophy intersects with the fundamental principles of the SDG framework_.”[^36] Consensus and collaborative actions according to India are key strategies to keep the flow development at a sustainable scale. “_India, home to one-sixth of all humanity, holds the key to the success of the 2030 Agenda. It has made a conscious paradigm shift to a ‘whole of society’ approach by engaging all key stakeholders – subnational and local governments, civil society, communities and private sector in collaborative adoption, implementation and evaluation of the SDGs. India’s second VNR is a true testament of this shift as it takes into account inputs and insights from multiple levels of the government, as well as from over a thousand civil society organizations, population groups in situations of vulnerability and the private sector_.”[^37]

To achieve the targets set by the SDG agenda 2030, India has evolved the SDG index[^38] for the attainment of all the 17 goals, and to meet various targets, the Government has evolved different schemes and has entrusted the responsibility for the implementation of such schemes to various departments.[^39] Depending upon the subject matter of these goals, the role of states and their specific local situations have also been identified.[^40] The state of Maharashtra emphasizes localizing the implementation of sustainable development goals.[^41]

**SDG India Index and Dashboard**

SDGs are benchmarks that a country has to achieve at different levels. A journey to its achievement becomes meaningful with constant monitoring and measuring of the progress with objective tools. SDG India Index is one such tool that aims to measure the progress, rank the performance of State and Union Territories, and initiate remedial action. NITI Aayog has developed the SDG India Index first in 2018\. The 2018 India Index covered 13 out of 17 SDGs (excepting Goals 12, 13, 14, and 17). The subsequent edition of 2019 was comprehensive, covering all the 17 Goals. The Index is accompanied by a dashboard. The dashboard facilitates the government, civil society, think tanks, and academia in carving out useful insights which the States/UTs can use for faster progress under the SDG framework.[^42] It also has a feedback system. The Indian Government has submitted two Voluntary National Review Reports (VNR) on Implementation of Sustainable Development Goals to the United Nations High-level Political Forum (HLPF). The first one was submitted in the year 2017[^43] followed by the other submitted in July 2020.[^44] It is interesting to observe that the 2017 VNR focused only on certain goals. The summary of the report states “_While reporting about the various facets of the SDGs, this VNR focuses on the progress made towards achieving Goals 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 14 and 17\. These Goals have been agreed upon in the HLPF as focus areas for this year. The nature of SDGs, however, is such that the advancement of one global goal may lead to progress in other goals as well_.”[^45] In short, the first report does not have any explicit bearing on the issue of accessibility and public spaces and does not refer to relevant Goals i.e., 10, 11, and 16\. The second report submitted by India (VNR 2020\) is titled ‘**\*Decade of Action: Taking SDGs from Global to Local\*\*\***.’[^46]\*\* It gives a comprehensive overview of schemes, programs, and planning done in respect of achieving each SDG. It also highlights challenges and the way forward in respect of each goal. For this report, however, a detailed discussion of SDGs is beside the point. This report would focus on Goal 11 which aims to ‘make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable’, and target 11.7 in particular, which aims to ‘provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green and public spaces, in particular, for women and children, older persons and persons with disabilities.’ The Ministry for Housing and Urban Affairs is responsible for achieving Target 11.7 in particular.[^47] Some discussion on Goal 10 (reduced inequalities) and Goal 16 (peace and justice) would not be out of place.

Underlying challenges for attainments of goal 11 which are dealt with in VNR (2020) are unregulated and indiscriminate urbanization, affordable housing for all, and making urbanization and mobility sustainable. To engage with these challenges Government of India has evolved some schemes, programs, missions at pan India level viz. Pradhan Mantri Avas Yojana (PMAY), Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), Smart Cities Mission (SCM), Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) 2017, National Urban Transport Policy (NUTP), Sustainable Urban Transport Project (SUTP). To monitor the implementation of the same and to have an overall perspective on urbanization, the Ease of Living Index was launched in 2019 focusing more on the outcomes and aims to assess the ease of living of citizens across the three pillars – the quality of life, economic ability, and sustainability, which are further divided into 14 categories across 50 indicators.[^48] There is hardly any discussion on PWD or elderly people, women, children. Although there is some reference to Women in Pradhan Mantri Avas Yojana (PMAY). Despite a very comprehensive policy framework and program, amnesia about the disabled appears to be due to a lack of effective representation and consultation with them.

Goal 10, addressed reduction in inequality, the main vehicle for the same in India is the Constitution of India and Statutory framework, executive action including affirmative programs. The main challenges are inequality of income and outcome, lack of equality of opportunities, inequality on account of sex, caste, disabilities, etc. Some of the sectorial interventions to reach the target of this goal are;

**Promoting income growth**, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN), Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana.

**Promoting Equality of Opportunities and Outcomes –** Samagra Shiksha programme, Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana, The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009\.

**Designing Specialized Development Programmes –** Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, Support to Training and Employment Programme for Women (STEP), and Deen Dayal Rehabilitation Scheme (DDRS) for persons with disabilities

**Expanding Social Protection Measures –** National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) provides pensions to the elderly, widows, and persons with disabilities. Ayushman Bharat Scheme provides free and quality healthcare services under annual insurance, Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) for life insurance, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) for accident insurance, and Atal Pension Yojana (APY) for monthly pension for unorganized sector workers, for life and personal accident insurance schemes (PMJJBY and PMSBY together), the Atal Pension Yojana.

**Empowering through Financial Inclusion –** Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY),

**Promoting Sustainable Migration and a Migrant-friendly Support System –** The Inter-State Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment And Conditions Of Service) Act, 1979[^49]

PWDs being one of the groups in a vulnerable situation, all the aforementioned interventions and the schemes have a direct bearing on their empowerment and normatively, have the potential to reduce inequality on account of disability. However, there is hardly any emphasis on gathering disability disaggregated data, particularly after the RPWDA, 2016 with the umbrella of disability getting extremely expansive covering 21 disabilities. In the absence of disability disaggregated data, the interventions may not be defective. Similarly, a lack of effective representation is yet another challenge that remains unaddressed. In respect of Goal 16 justice, liberty and equality are the key cornerstones on which Constitutional edifice stands, all national, state, and local level institutions are informed by these ideals. Fundamental Rights and Directive Principle of State Policy enshrined in our Constitution also reflect these ideals and empower the citizens by obligating the States to foster respect for the same. Since these ideals play a key role in attaining the targets set by Goal 16, the following has been identified by VNR 2020 as the broad parameters of the way forward;

**Reducing Violence**

India has long ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), National Policy for Children, legislation, and policies dealing with survival, health and nutrition, education and development, and protection and participation; the laws deal with specific issues of the rights of children, such as the provision of care and protection, right to education, prevention of violence and abuse, child labour and trafficking, and sexual exploitation. Unfortunately, no reference is made to UNCRPD or RPWD Act, 2016\.

**Access to Justice**

“India has made sustained efforts to end discrimination and exclusion of people belonging to different socio-economic strata. Initiatives have been launched for other groups in vulnerable situations as well. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, lays down a concrete legal framework and provides higher visibility and entitlement to persons with disabilities.”[^50]

**Accountable and Transparent Institutions**

VNR identifies The Right to Information Act, 2005, Lokpal (at the National level), Lokayukta (at the State level), Auditor General (CAG) of India as accountable and transparent institutions. To promote participatory governance, schemes like the Digital India campaign (focused on providing e-governance solutions for citizen-centric projects) and the PRAGATI platform (an IT-based grievance redressal and monitoring system extending to the district/sub-district level) are implemented.

**Ethics in Governance**

To ensure ethics in governance The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, The Lok Pal and Lokayukta Act, 2013, The Whistleblower Protection Act, 2014 and Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, etc. are enacted. To deter unlawful acquisition of assets the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, 2018, the Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) Imposition of Tax Act in 2015 are made.

**Legal Identity for All**

Aadhaar, a unique identification system is introduced. Aadhaar card gives legal identity to citizens of India. The VNR claims 90% coverage of citizens. Whether Aadhaar can provide legal identity to PWDs and whether entitlement provided to them under RPWD Act, 2016 can be guaranteed to them effectively by Aadhaar card is a challenge and awaits credible solution. Particularly since the schemes and benefits provided to the PWDs differ state-wise. How the Aadhaar scheme can be effective is a questionable proposition.

Major challenges identified in VNR, 2020 are inadequacy of comprehensive and disaggregated data,[^51] inadequate coverage vis-à-vis lack of internet access and digital literacy, data privacy, and security concerns in respect of Aadhaar.

To sum up ‘leave no one behind’, one of the core principles underlying SDGs is implicit in Constitution, legislations, schemes, programs, and initiatives launched by India having bearing on all 17 goals; however, its concretization vis-à-vis disabled is still a stiff challenge.

### **A2.3 Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)**

ESCAP is the only Regional Commission of the United Nations that has been promoting the rights of PWDs through the three consecutive regional disability-specific decades that started in 1993\. The ongoing [Asian and Pacific Decade of Persons with Disabilities](https://www.unescap.org/resources/escap-resolutions-asian-and-pacific-decade-persons-disabilities-2013-2022), from 2013 to 2022, is guided by the [Incheon Strategy to “Make the Right Real” for Persons with Disabilities in Asia and the Pacific](https://www.unescap.org/resources/incheon-strategy-%25E2%2580%259Cmake-right-real%25E2%2580%259D-persons-disabilities-asia-and-pacific).”.[^52] ESCAP has established a working group overseas to monitor the progress made by the States in achieving the goals set out for the decades in general and UNCRPD in particular. The working group consists of 15 member states and 15 Civil Society organizations active in this region. India is one of the state parties.[^53]

The mandate of the working group is to;

1. Review of Decade progress, especially concerning the implementation of the Ministerial Declaration on the Asian and Pacific Decade of Persons with Disabilities, 2013–2022, and the Incheon Strategy to “Make the Right Real” for Persons with Disabilities in Asia and the Pacific;

2. Regional and subregional cooperation to advance implementation of the Ministerial Declaration and the Incheon Strategy;

3. Research on the evolving situation of persons with disabilities in the Asia-Pacific region;

4. Outreach to diverse disability groups at the national and local levels, and networking.[^54]

### **A2.4 BIWAKO Millennium Framework for Action**

This framework was adopted by the Governments in the ESCAP region, India being one of such governments, at the end of the First Decade (1993-2002) of Asian and Pacific Decade of Disabled Persons.[^55] It is one of the foundation sources, underlying the Incheon Strategy. One of the principles to promote the inclusive, barrier-free, and rights based society, set out in this framework is “Adopt the concept of universal and inclusive design for all citizens, which is cost-effective, in the development of infrastructure and services in the areas of, inter alia, rural and urban development, housing, transport and telecommunication.”[^56] All the goals set out in this declaration were to be accomplished by 2007, however, the Governments could not meet these deadlines and, therefore to accomplish the unattended objectives of the declaration Biwako Plus Five was adopted[^57]. One of the targets recommended by the framework was, ‘E. Access to built environments and public transport.’

### **A2.5 Biwako Plus Five**

Biwako Plus Five was adopted at the High-level Intergovernmental Meeting on the Midpoint Review of the Asian and Pacific Decade of Disabled Persons, 2003-2012, held in Bangkok from September 2007\. In a way, Biwako Plus Five supplemented the Biwako Millennium Framework for Action.[^58] As a complementary instrument, it was supposed to adhere to core principles and policy directions set out in the Biwako Millennium Framework for Action.

### **A2.6 Incheon Strategy**

Governments of the ESCAP region gathered in Incheon, Republic of Korea, from 29 October to 2 November 2012 to chart the course of the new Asian and Pacific Decade of Persons with Disabilities for the period 2013 to 2022\. They were joined by representatives of civil society organizations, including organizations of and for persons with disabilities, intergovernmental organizations, development cooperation agencies, and the United Nations system. The High-level Intergovernmental Meeting on the Final Review of the Implementation of the Asian and Pacific Decade of Disabled Persons, 2003–2012, was organized by ESCAP and hosted by the Government of the Republic of Korea. The Meeting marked the conclusion of the second Asian and Pacific Decade of Disabled Persons, 2003–2012, and launched the new Decade.[^59] During this meeting, a Ministerial Declaration on the Asian and Pacific Decade of Persons with Disabilities, 2013–2022, and the Incheon Strategy to “Make the Right Real” for Persons with Disabilities in Asia and the Pacific were adopted.

The Incheon Strategy is a first of its kind document, unraveling and identifying disability-inclusive development goals, thereby being a forerunner even to SDGs. It is an important gap-filler in the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) agenda from 2000-2015. Drawing from UNCRPD and BIWAKO Millennium Framework for Action and Biwako Plus Five, Incheon Strategy consists of 10 goals, 27 targets, and 62 indicators.

The Governments falling under the ESCAP region are obligated to report every three years until the end of the decade in 2022, on progress in the implementation of the Ministerial Declaration and the Incheon Strategy. This strategy is an important index to track the implementation of UNCRPD and may prove a catalyst for the achievements of targets set by SDGs.

The Incheon strategy has adopted all the general principles enshrined in Article 3 of the UNCRPD as its key principles, of particular relevance for this report is ‘f’ i.e., the principle of accessibility. Amongst the 10 goals, goal 3 is most pertinent providing “Enhance access to the physical environment, public transportation, knowledge, information, and communication.” The phrase physical environment is most appropriate to capture accessibility of streets, pavements, sidewalks, squares, and market places. As the Incheon Strategy is a regional instrument to effectively implement and enforce the provisions of UNCRPD and India having ratified the same, Supreme Courts and High Courts in India can interpret the fundamental right to Freedom of movement in light of Goal 3 of Incheon Strategy and issue appropriate directions to the competent authorities to make streets, pavements, sidewalks, squares and market places accessible. Similarly, goal 9, with its twin objectives to accelerate the ratification and implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and to harmonize national legislation with the Convention, is equally important. In India, under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, the Department of Disability Affairs has been designated as the focal point for compliance with the mandate of the Incheon Strategy and the decade.[^60]

**Road map for the implementation of the Incheon Strategy**

To achieve the goals set out in Incheon Strategy, the ESCAP has adopted a road map in the year 2013\. Action has been identified at three different levels namely: regional, sub-regional and national under the road map. It prescribes the timeline for the goals and targets to be achieved. For the purposes of this report, the timeline set out for achieving goal 3 is relevant.

For attaining goal 3, the strategy has identified four targets, and to track the progress of these targets, five core indicators and supplementary indicators have been identified.

**Target 3.A**

Increase the accessibility of the physical environment in the national capital that is open to the public.

**Target 3.B**

Enhance the accessibility and usability of public transportation.

**Target 3.C**

Enhance the accessibility and usability of information and communications services.

**Target 3.D**

Halve the proportion of persons with disabilities who need but do not have appropriate assistive devices or products.

**Indicators for tracking progress**

**Core indicators**

3.1 Proportion of accessible government buildings in the national capital.

3.2 Proportion of accessible international airports.

3.3 Proportion of daily captioning and sign-language interpretation of public television news programmes.

3.4 Proportion of accessible and usable public documents and websites that meet internationally recognized accessibility standards.3.5 Proportion of persons with disabilities who need assistive devices or products and have them.

**Supplementary indicators**

3.6 Availability of a government access audit programme that requires the participation of experts with disabilities.

3.7 Availability of mandatory technical standards for barrier-free access that govern the approval of all designs for buildings that could be used by members of the public, taking into consideration internationally recognized standards, such as those of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

3.8 Number of sign language interpreters.

3.9 Availability of mandatory technical standards for barrier-free access that govern the approval of all ICT-related services, such as websites for the public, taking into consideration internationally recognized standards, such as those of the ISO. To assess the progress of implementation of the Incheon strategy, a report titled “Building Disability‑Inclusive Societies in Asia and the Pacific Assessing Progress of the Incheon Strategy” was published in the year 2017\. It is the first major document outlining the baseline of the compilation of data reported by 35 governments including India. One of the major challenges identified by this report is “persistent exclusion of persons with disabilities in different development areas across the region and numerous limitations in legal and policy measures that prevent their full participation across all sectors of society”[^61] To support governments in Asia and the Pacific for the remainder of the third Asian and Pacific Decade of Persons with Disabilities (from 2018 to 2022\) and to further promote disability-inclusive development, the report recommended the following actions.

_a) Establishing and/or strengthening a national coordination mechanism on disability, with the power to draft disability-specific and disability-inclusive policies and review their implementation, as well as strengthen multi-ministerial, intra-ministerial and multisectoral cooperation on disability inclusion and check whether principles of accessibility, universal design and non-discrimination are duly reflected in laws, policies and regulations………………_

_f) Developing and adopting and implementing universal design-based technical standards on the accessibility of the built environment, including accessible toilets, transportation, information, communication and technologies that underpin multi-ministerial work on accessibility……………._

_i)Promoting good governance, multi-ministerial cooperation and the allocation of appropriate budget and sufficient human resources equipped with sufficient technical_ knowledge.”[^62]

In order to achieve this objective, the report recommends the Governments to ensure “that policies and programmes help fulfil the rights of persons with disabilities and ensure their full participation in society, through all stages of the life cycle by Establishing and/or strengthening a national coordination mechanism on disability, with the power to draft disability-specific and disability-inclusive policies and review their implementation, as well as strengthen multi-ministerial, intra-ministerial and multisectoral cooperation on disability inclusion and check whether principles of accessibility, universal design and non-discrimination are duly reflected in laws, policies and regulations”[^63], for the remainder of the third Asian and Pacific Decade of Persons with Disabilities from 2018 to 2022\.

### **A2.7 Beijing Declaration and the Action Plan to Accelerate the Implementation of the Incheon Strategy**

To give a base to the goals enshrined in the Incheon Strategy, the Beijing Declaration, and the Action Plan to Accelerate the Implementation of the Incheon Strategy was adopted in 2017 by the working group based on the experiences of the first five years(2013–2017), post-adoption of Incheon Strategy drawing from a session of 2014 and 2017, and expert inputs and responses to the surveys conducted by the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) on the midpoint review of the decade in 2017.[^64]

Following the Road map mentioned earlier and emphasizing the synergy of the Incheon Strategy and SDGs, the action plan recommends the following policy measures vis-à-vis goal 3 of the Incheon Strategy to be adopted by the appropriate Governments for the remainder of the third Asian and Pacific Decade of Persons with Disabilities from 2018 to 2022\.

**Action to be taken by Governments**

Governments should: (a) Develop, adopt and implement laws and regulations to promote universal design and accessibility in the built environment, information and communications technology ecosystems, facilities, and services at all levels of government and in the private sector, including by establishing accessibility requirements for constructing and renovating the built environment and as a criterion for granting business permits; (b) Develop, adopt and implement technical standards, based on universal design and in line with international standards, for making the built environment – including toilets, changing areas, and transportation – information and communications technology ecosystems and other services accessible; (c) Ensure that technical standards on accessibility highlight seamless connectivity between destinations and guarantee the safety of persons with physical, mental, intellectual, sensory, and other impairments, and that standards in a country or area are the same across ministries and governance levels, by inter alia (i) Adopting a procurement policy to ensure that all government devices, goods, services and software that are accessible to persons with disabilities are in line with accessibility standards, and promoting the adoption of the policy in the private sector; (ii) Taking steps to make government websites and their contents accessible, in accordance with World Wide Web Consortium standards;

(iii) In collaboration with academic institutions, providing training programmes on universal design for policymakers, building inspectors and contractors, and integrating universal design and accessibility into higher education curricula related to architecture, urban planning, transport, civil engineering and other relevant academic branches;

(iv) Devising and implementing a system to conduct regular accessibility audits of key public buildings and transportation hubs, key government offices, schools, hospitals and emergency shelters, business centres, houses/places of worship and any other public places before construction and periodically once in use; (e)Establish and implement a system for the provision of affordable assistive devices in response to the needs of persons with disabilities.

### **A2.8 Expert Meeting on Creating Universal Design-based Accessible Societies in Asia and the Pacific[^65]**

An Expert Meeting on Creating Universal Design-based Accessible Societies in Asia and the Pacific was held on 13 and 14 December 2018, hosted and organized by the Social Development Division of ESCAP. The meeting provided inputs for the creation of a Guide Book on Accessibility in 2019\. The fifth Session of the Working group on the implementation of the Incheon Strategy was held in Thailand, where, as per the Report of the session, India participated in an in-depth discussion, inter-alia, on Goal 3.[^66] However, the ESCAP website does not have a detailed report of this discussion.

**Reporting**

During the first session of the working group, it was resolved by the Governments and the organizations, to submit reports of the progress of implementations of Incheon Strategy, to ESCAP, in prescribed templates.[^67] However, the country reports presented by the various Governments are not available on the website of the ESCAP.[^68]

## **A3 Multinational Law and Policy**

### **A3.1.1 Strategies and Action Plans**

### **A3.2 Multinational System 2**

NA

## **A4 Republic of India Strategy, Law and Policy**

### **A4.1 Equality and Inclusion**

#### **_A4.1.1 Equality_**

Although India does not have any disability–specific general equality strategy, the National Policy Statement for Persons with Disabilities emphasizes “equal opportunities, protection of their rights and full participation in society.”[^69] The Preamble of the Indian Constitution stresses the equality of opportunities. However, more importantly, India has an entrenched Bill of Rights as part of its written Constitution. Article 14 one of the fundamental Rights lays down _“The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India”._ Articles 15 and 16 prohibit discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth. Articles 41 and 46 the Directive Principles of State Policy in part 4 of the Constitution obligate the State to make effective provision for securing the right to work, education and to public assistance in cases of unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement, and in other cases of undeserved want, within the limits of its economic capacity and development; and to promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people, and, in particular, of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, and shall protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation.

**Transformative Constitutionalism**

Transformative Constitutionalism aims at bringing emancipation in the life course of the repressed and oppressed. It also aims at evolving and fine-tuning the machinery of the state to capture and cajole even the minutest forms of differences to challenge regimentation and to promote the ideal of equal protection by laws. To attain the objectives underlying the aforementioned principles, the Indian Constitution has evolved the mechanism of enabling provisions – Article 15 (3) enables the State to make provisions for the advancement of women, Article 15 (4) for the advancement of socially and educationally backward classes and Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, Article 15 (5) extends the same to the sphere of higher education while Article 15 (6) empowers the State to take all the above measures in respect of the economically weaker sections.

Article 16 extends the same powers to the spheres of employment. Courts are empowered to enforce all these enabling provisions anchoring Fundamental Rights under Part III. The beauty of the enabling provisions is that not only the same enables the state to exercise the powers but if the state is found wanting action in exercising the powers through these enabling provisions, the courts may also direct their writs towards the states to remind them of their obligation. Interestingly, the Supreme Court has time and again stated that its jurisdiction under Article 32 (enforcement of fundamental rights) travels well beyond adversarial jurisdiction.

**Towards Rights enabling conditions**

As has been aptly provided by Professor Amartya Sen, mere conferment of rights without the creation of rights-enabling conditions does not bring out the equality of results. To instil capabilities in citizens, therefore, along with the conferment of freedoms, elimination of unfreedoms is essential. Similarly, along with the creation of equality, the elimination of inequality must also go hand in hand. For attaining this objective, India does not have any equality Act nor have we evolved, what are characterized as structural duties by Prof Sandra Fredman. Nevertheless, the Constitution of India does contain a set of duties under the rubric of fundamental duties under Article 51-A viz. _“It shall be the duty of every citizen of India…. (h) to develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform”._ This duty assumes significance in the light of an attitudinal deficit in society about disability i.e., weaving disability as a cause of bad karma in the past life or perceiving people with disabilities as less eligible or unfit or incompetent by locating disability in the body. If the idea of raising of scientific temper is directed at contesting such imagery of the disabled and to conscientize the members of civil society about the potential and talent in the disabled, the same would not merely enhance equality in the society but would also lead to anti-stereotype. The same is also in line with India’s obligation flowing from Article 8 of the UNCRPD (in its relevant part) calling the state parties,

“(a) To raise awareness throughout society, including at the family level, regarding persons with disabilities, and to foster respect for the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities; (b) To combat stereotypes, prejudices and harmful practices relating to persons with disabilities, including those based on sex and age, in all areas of life;

(c) To promote awareness of the capabilities and contributions of persons with disabilities”. ‘Humanism’, another element in the aforementioned fundamental duty, also directs the attention on the same. Article 51-A _“It shall be the duty of every citizen of India…. (j) to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavor and achievement;”_

To raise the nation to a higher level of endeavor and achievement, it is necessary to direct the policy initiatives and the programs of states to fulfill the interests of all the sections of society, and particular attention must be paid to those who are less represented in the system and to whom the design of the social structure is not congenial. Thus, one of the achievements and endeavors envisaged by this duty may be the promotion of the right to equal access, nurturance of universal design. To this end, attention of the Union of India may also be directed at Article 9 of UNCRPD (in its relevant part) calling upon State parties “To enable persons with disabilities to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life, States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access, on an equal basis with others, to the physical environment, to transportation, to information and communications, including information and communications technologies and systems, and to other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas. These measures, which shall include the identification and elimination of obstacles and barriers to accessibility….”. _Article 51- A “It shall be the duty of every citizen of India…. (k) who is a parent or guardian to provide opportunities for education to his child or, as the case may be, ward between the age of six and fourteen years.”_

The right to free and compulsory education to disabled children in India is recognized and they are expected to receive free and compulsory education between the ages of 6 to 18 years. Recognizing the horizontal dimension of this right, parents are obligated to send their children to schools. As it is a fundamental right, its compliance has to be expected at the highest level and for the same, the state is under an obligation to take initiatives including provision for financial incentives to the parents of disabled children to send them to the schools. This is so because, in India, even now, the parents do not entertain any productive expectations of prospects from children with disabilities. Schools are obligated to create a barrier-free environment and facilitate the prosecution of inclusive education. To concretize these objectives, apart from creating a trained human resource, attention must also be paid to generate gadgets and equipment providing impetus for accessibility. In this connection, reference may also be made to The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009.[^70] It is also necessary to note that though these fundamental duties are not enforceable in the court of law, courts are expected to take cognizance during the interpretation of the law, the legislature during the enactment of the law. Similarly, the Constitution of India also contains a set of principles by way of guidance to the legislature. Article 37 of part IV of the Indian Constitution lays down that although the Directive Principles of State Policy are not enforceable in a court of law, it shall be the duty of the state to take these principles into account while making laws. It is interesting to conceptualize this duty. Can it be argued that the notion of enforceability is not exhausted by adjudication. In fact, obligations structural in nature are ill-suited to be adjudicated through the adversarial process. The better option in certain cases may be to create an interactive and dialogic mechanism and reach wholesome decisions. The Chief Commissioner and the State Commissioner for disability in India may perform such ombudsmanic roles and can generate collaborative activism in the system. In this connection, we would like to direct attention to the following articles of Part IV of the Constitution of India.

Article 38\. State to secure a social order for the promotion of welfare of the people

(1) The State shall strive to promote the welfare of the people by securing and protecting as effectively as it may a social order in which justice, social, economic and political, shall inform all the institutions of the national life.  
(2) The State shall, in particular, strive to minimize the inequalities in income, and endeavor to eliminate inequalities in status, facilities and opportunities, not only amongst individuals but also amongst groups of people residing in different areas or engaged in different vocations.

This Article, alongside Article 5 of the UNCRPD may prove to be a very effective equality booster. Baby steps like the creation of newer opportunities in employment, opening new vistas of employment for the disabled, eliminating barriers in the built-in environment may prove to be giant endeavours in enhancing equality to the Indian society; particularly, the role of reasonable accommodation and the creation of support mechanisms may also be emphasized.

Article 39\. Certain principles of policy to be followed by the State.—The State shall, in particular, direct its policy towards securing— (a) that the citizens, men and women equally, have the right to an adequate means of livelihood; (b)that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as best to subserve the common good; (c) that the operation of the economic system does not result in the concentration of wealth and means of production to the common detriment; (d) that there is equal pay for equal work for both men and women; (e) that the health and strength of workers, men and women, and the tender age of children are not abused and that citizens are not forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited to their age or strength; (f) that children are given opportunities and facilities to develop in a healthy manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity and that childhood and youth are protected against exploitation and against moral and material abandonment. The wording of this article sounds no less than the Rawlsian notion of equitable society but in an un-Rawlsian manner i.e., by giving priority to redistribution and recognition to those who cannot act as cooperative members of society due to their vulnerability and marginalization. The underlying objective of Article 39 is to inform the policy of the state to prioritize the empowerment of the powerless. The same is possible only when the ableist structures are contested and the state policy is injected with respect for difference and diversity. Several Articles of UNCRPD be it Article 5, 9, 24, 27 appear to crosscut the broad ages of Article 39\.

Another two relevant Articles are Article 41 and 46 mentioned above (See A1). These articles somewhat concretize the ideals underlying Article 38 and 39\. The comments made to analyse the earlier two articles are mutatis mutandis applicable to these two articles and need not, therefore, be repeated. Just like the fundamental duties, the Directive Principles of State Policy are also not enforceable in the Courts. But they would be foul of adhering to transformative constitutionalism if the cognizance of these principles is found wanting in the interpretation of the Constitution and the Statutes.

**Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016**

With the enactment of the RPWD Act, 2016 for the first time in India, discrimination on the ground of physical and mental disability has been explicitly prohibited subject to a rider.

Section 3 of the RPWD Act lays down

_“(1) The appropriate Government[^71] shall ensure that the persons with disabilities enjoy the right to equality, life with dignity and respect for his or her integrity equally with others._

_(2) The appropriate Government shall take steps to utilise the capacity of persons with disabilities by providing appropriate environment._

_(3) No person with disability shall be discriminated on the ground of disability, unless it is shown that the impugned act or omission is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim……………………._

_(5) The appropriate Government shall take necessary steps to ensure reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities_.”

Reasonable accommodation has been defined under Section 2 (y) as _"reasonable accommodation" means necessary and appropriate modification and adjustments, without imposing a disproportionate or undue burden in a particular case, to ensure to persons with disabilities the enjoyment or exercise of rights equally with others._”

Although the Indian Constitution does not expressly prohibit discrimination on the ground of physical and mental disability, the judiciary by creative interpretation has read it as one of the grounds of non-discrimination in a number of decisions.[^72] Delhi High Court[^73] even went so far as to say that grounds of non-discrimination, which are not mentioned in Article 15, can be inferred as part of the non-discrimination regime through Article 14\. Understood in this way, Section 3 of the RPWD Act, 2016[^74] may be said to be the extension of the equality regime under the Indian Constitution. It may also be characterized as a super-statute.[^75] Super Statutes have a higher value than ordinary legislation as their impact is enduring and has the same status as the provisions of the Constitution.

It goes without saying that the RPWD Act, 2016 is bound to sharpen the state machinery in its endeavour towards mainstreaming and upstreaming the constitutional status of PWDs. Justice D Y Chandrachud, recently, had an occasion to articulate the reasonable accommodation obligation of the State in the lank mark judgment Vikash Kumar v. Union Public Service Commission and Ors.[^76] He observed “_Intrinsic to its realization is recognizing the worth of every person as an equal member of society. Respect for the dignity of others and fostering conditions in which every individual can evolve according to their capacities are key elements of a legal order which protects, respects, and facilitates individual autonomy. In seeking to project these values as inalienable rights of the disabled, the RPwD Act, 2016 travels beyond being merely a charter of non-discrimination. It travels beyond imposing restraints on discrimination against the disabled. The law does this by imposing a positive obligation on the State to secure the realization of rights. It does so by mandating that the State must create conditions in which the barriers posed by disability can be overcome. The creation of an appropriate environment in which the disabled can pursue the full range of entitlements that are encompassed within human liberty is enforceable at law. In its emphasis on substantive equality, the enactment of the legislation is a watershed event in providing a legal foundation for equality of opportunity to the disabled_”[^77]. Addressing the ableist design of the state machinery and apathy of the society the learned judge shades light on the emancipatory path envisaged by the RPWD Act, 2016\.

_“As a social construct, disability encompasses features broader and more comprehensive than a medical condition. The RPWD Act, 2016 recognizes that disability results in inequality of access to a range of public and private entitlements. The handicaps which the disabled encounter emerge out of disability’s engagement with the barriers created by prejudice, discrimination and societal indifference. Operating as restraining factors, these barriers have origins which can be traced to physical, social, economic and psychological conditions in society. Operating on the pre-existing restraints posed by disability, these barriers to development produce outcomes in which the disabled bear an unequal share of societal burdens. The legislation has recognized that remedies for the barriers encountered by the disabled are to be found in the social environment in which they live, work and co-habit with others. The barriers encountered by every disabled person can be remedied by recognizing comprehensive rights as inhering in them; rights which impose duties and obligations on others_.”[^78]

On this background, he highlights the role of reasonable accommodation in the Indian legal order. He further observes “_The principle of reasonable accommodation acknowledges that if disability as a social construct has to be remedied, conditions have to be affirmatively created for facilitating the development of the disabled. Reasonable accommodation is founded in the norm of inclusion. Exclusion results in the negation of individual dignity and worth or they can choose the route of reasonable accommodation, where each individuals’ dignity and worth is respected. Under this route, the “powerful and the majority adapt their own rules and practices, within the limits of reason and short of undue hardship, to permit realization_ _of these ends_.[^79]” _“In the specific context of disability, the principle of reasonable accommodation postulates that the conditions which exclude the disabled from full and effective participation as equal members of society have to give way to an accommodative society which accepts difference, respects their needs and facilitates the creation of an environment in which the societal barriers to disability are progressively answered. Accommodation implies a positive obligation to create conditions conducive to the growth and fulfilment of the disabled in every aspect of their existence – whether as students, members of the workplace, participants in governance or, on a personal plane, in realizing the fulfilling privacies of family life. The accommodation which the law mandates is ‘reasonable’ because it has to be tailored to the requirements of each condition of disability. The expectations which every disabled person has are unique to the nature of the disability and the character of the impediments which are encountered as its consequence._” [^80]

**Other relevant legislation**

**National Commissioner for Women Act, 1990**

In this connection, reference is also to be made to one of the relevant functions of the National Commission for Women, Section 10(f) lays down “_The commission shall perform……(f) to look into the complaints and take suo-moto[^81] notice of matters relating to (ii) non implementation of laws enacted to provide protection to women and also to achieve the objective of equality and development.”_

**Mental Health Care Act, 2017**

In the year 2017, the Parliament of India enacted a very comprehensive legislation to address mental health care. One of the ideas underlying this law is to afford equal treatment to persons with mental illness. In this connection, Section 21 recognizing the right to equality and non-discrimination of persons with mental illness is most noteworthy.

In its relevant part it reads _“(1) Every person with mental illness shall be treated as equal to persons with physical illness in the provision of all healthcare which shall include the following, namely:– (a) there shall be no discrimination on any basis including gender, sex, sexual orientation, religion, culture, caste, social or political beliefs, class or disability; (b) emergency facilities and emergency services for mental illness shall be of the same quality and availability as those provided to persons with physical illness; (c) persons with mental illness shall be entitled to the use of ambulance services in the same manner, extent and quality as provided to persons with physical illness; (d) living conditions in health establishments shall be of the same manner, extent and quality as provided to persons with physical illness; and (e) any other health services provided to persons with physical illness shall be provided in same manner, extent and quality to persons with mental illness_………”.[^82]

#### **_A4.1.2 Accessibility_**

In India, we do not have a general accessibility strategy. However, as one of the state parties to the BIWAKO Millennium Framework for Action, the UNCRPD, the Incheon strategy, SDGs, etc. the Government of India is committed to promoting accessibility which is referred to in Indian legislation as ‘barrier-free environment’. It is submitted that whether elimination of barriers from the built environment is analogous to the promotion of accessibility and universal design is an empirical question. By this statement, it is meant that, while going for the elimination of barriers, consultation with experts is essential, because what may be barrier-free from the perspective of government may not be the case with experts.

The persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act,1995 under Sections 8(f) and 9 (e) the Central Coordination Committee and the Central Executive committee were obligated to “_ensure barrier free environment in public places, work places, public utilities, schools and other institutions_”. An identical obligation is cast on appropriate government vis-à-vis schools under Section 30(b) to remove “_architectural barriers from schools, colleges or other institutions imparting vocational and professional training_”.

Evidently, the focus of this legislation was mainly on architectural barriers. However, with the entry into force of UNCRPD in 2008, accessibility not only has been designated as one of the overarching principles under Article 3 of UNCRPD but the principle of accessibility also radiates into General Obligations set forth in Article 4; put specifically para (f) reads

“_To undertake or promote research and development of universally designed goods, services, equipment and facilities, as defined in article 2 of the present Convention, which should require the minimum possible adaptation and the least cost to meet the specific needs of a person with disabilities, to promote their availability and use, and to promote universal design in the development of standards and guidelines”_.

Besides, the Convention also dedicates an entire Article i.e., Article 9 to rearticulate the importance of accessibility in the empowerment of PWDs. The Convention advocates a very expansive and cutting-edge meaning of accessibility.

**Barrier-free Environment under RPWD Act, 2016**

Despite a dedicated Article in the UNCRPD and the inclusion of accessibility as one of the substantive principles and general obligations, the Parliament of India appears to have adopted a very blunt approach while translating it as part of the Indian Legal Order, under the RPWD Act, 2016\.

Firstly, the term accessibility does appear in certain sections of the RPWD Act. Its reference is mostly sectoral i.e., in a specific sphere alone. Interestingly in the definition section of the Act, instead of accessibility, the terms ‘barrier’[^83] and ‘universal designed’[^84] are invoked and defined.

So far as substantive provisions of the Act are concerned, under Section 8 dealing with armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies, and natural disasters, state parties are obligated while undertaking reconstruction activities posted above while remaining sensitive to accessibility vis-à-vis PWDs. [^85]

Section 11 dealing with electioneering emphasizes accessibility vis-à-vis PWDs in respect of polling booths and other allied matters.

Section 40 again sounds like casting obligations on the Central Government in consultation with the Chief Commissioner of Disability to “_formulate rules for persons with disabilities laying down the standards of accessibility for the physical environment, transportation, information and communications, including appropriate technologies and systems, and other facilities and services provided to the public in urban and rural areas_.”[^86]

Section 41, apart from emphasizing accessible transportation in all its forms, also specifically obligates the State to provide accessible roads and to address the mobility necessary for persons with disabilities.

Section 42 deals with Access to information and communication technology.

Section 43 harps on the adoption of universal design in respect of _“consumer products and accessories for general use for persons with disabilities_”.

The key provision amongst the aforementioned Sections is Section 40, which casts a duty on the Central Government to evolve rules and standard of accessibility, Section 45 though prescribes a timeline of 5 years to comply with the mandate of Section 40, the same has been compromised by giving powers to the Central Government to extend the same without prescribing any limits. And the story of Section 46 casting obligations on service providers to adhere to accessibility standards is not any different. Thus, amidst the watered-down regime of Sections 45 and 46, Section 44 imposing an obligation on the appropriate government to mandatorily observe accessibility norms roars like a toothless paper tiger.

To demonstrate its commitment to the principle of accessibility, the Government of India has inaugurated its Accessible India Campaign (3 December 2015\) with much fan-fare.

**Accessible India Campaign**

In order to implement goal 3, the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (DEPwD) has launched the Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan), as a nationwide campaign for achieving universal accessibility for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs).[^87]

The campaign has the following objectives and targets:

**Part A: Built Environment Accessibility**

**Objective 1 – Enhancing the proportion of accessible government buildings.**

**Target 1.1** has two levels, to be implemented in tier 1 and tier 2 cities. Conducting accessibility audit of at least 50 most important government buildings and converting them into fully accessible buildings by July 2016 in tier 1 cities. Out of 26 cities identified for achieving this objective, two of the cities are Pune and Delhi. And conducting accessibility audit of at least 25 most important government buildings and converting them into fully accessible buildings by July 2016 in the tier two cities. Unfortunately, there is no record available in the public domain as to its compliance. **Target 1.2** aimed at converting 50% of all the government buildings of the National Capital and all the State capitals into fully accessible buildings by July 2018.[^88]. **Target 1.3** aimed at conducting an audit of 50% of the government buildings and converting them into fully accessible buildings by July 2019\.

Besides going for accessible audit and making the important governmental buildings accessible, there was also a focus on the accessibility of airports (international airports by 2016, Domestic airports by March 2018), [^89] railway stations (A1, A & B categories of railway stations in the country by July 2016), and ensuring that 50% of railway stations in the country are converted into fully accessible railway stations (March 2018\) and public transport accessible (25% of the Government-owned public transport carriers in the country by March 2018\. Unfortunately, the Campaign does not make any reference to streets; however, transportation being a part of public realm, we have referred to the same. There is also a focus on the accessibility of Information and Communication Eco-System Accessibility in Part C.

**Guidelines and Legislative provisions on accessibility**

**National Building Code 1983**

For the first time, the issue of accessibility of public spaces including public buildings came to the forefront in the first revision of the National Building Code 1983.[^90]

**National Building code 2005**

National Building Code 2005 is an improvement over its counterpart of 1983\. Although the predominant focus of the Code is buildings, the methodology used therein applies to streets. Besides, the Code also makes a reference to internal roads appurtenant to buildings. The Harmonized Guidelines and Space Standards for Barrier-Free Built Environment for Persons with Disabilities and Elderly Persons, the official standard under the RPWD Act, 2016 for evaluation of accessibility issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Urban Development in 2016 under Rule 15 of RPWD Rules 2017 also refers to National Building Code, 2005\. The code had a dedicated Annex in Part 3, titled, ‘Special Requirement for Planning of Public Buildings Meant for Use of Physically Challenged.’

However, it was not very visible nor was its expertise taken into cognizance by the architects and civil engineers. The requirements specified in the annex were confined to public buildings. To briefly allude to the mandate of the code –

\*“**D-2 SITE DEVELOPMENT\***

**\*D-2.1** Almost any building can be made accessible to physically challenged persons by so planning the site that the terraces, retaining walls and winding walks are used effectively.\*

**\*D-2.1.1** Site development is the most effective means to resolve the problems created by topography, definitive architectural designs or concepts, water table, existing streets, and typical problems, singularly or collectively, so that aggress, ingress and egress to buildings by physically challenged may be facilitated while preserving the desired design and effect of the architecture*.”[^91] The requirements of accessibility in respect of walks, parking spaces, and almost every aspect of public buildings like doors, doorways, windows, sanitary facilities, public telephones, etc. were highlighted. “*In the first paragraph of this Annexure, it was mentioned that the provisions apply to all buildings and facilities used by the public and that they apply to temporary and emergency conditions as well. However, in spite of these clear statements, the Annexure was ignored by architects and builders. The other Parts of NBC 2005 did not mention accessibility or provide any reference to this Annexure. Based on several study reports, most architects, builders, contractors and other professionals in the construction business were not even aware of this Annexure in NBC. Moreover, the accessibility standards given in the Annexure were neither comprehensive nor of a high standard. It was comprehensively rejected by the accessibility experts. Though several other guidelines for accessibility for built environment were formulated by the Ministry of Urban Development, for example, the CPWD Guidelines, Harmonised Guidelines, and so on. These guidelines are hardly being used by construction professionals\*.”[^92] Thus, to conclude, it accessibility was addressed only in an annexure, this did not clearly apply to the public realm (roads, pavements, etc) and, in so far as it did lay down guidelines relating to accessibility, those have been largely ignored.

**National Building Code 2016**

In the 2016 code, there is an observable transformation in the approach of the state to a more active engagement and interaction with stakeholders. In this connection it would be appropriate to quote; _“The ‘exclusive’ approach, followed in NBC 2005, where accessibility standards were only in the Annexure has been corrected in National Building Code 2016\. The accessibility of persons with disabilities has now been explicitly mentioned in all the relevant chapters. It has also been mentioned several times within chapters as and when required with a cross-reference being made to the accessibility standards detailed in Part 3\. In the main Foreword of NBC 2016, it is mentioned that “The major changes incorporated in this third revision of the Code are as follows: Requirements for accessibility in buildings and built environment for persons with disabilities and the elderly have been thoroughly revised and updated_.”[^93] One of the key features of the 2016 code is to officially recognise accessibility and universal design specialists as mainstream professionals for the planning and development of a built environment and provision for periodical accessibility audit for universal accessibility of the buildings.[^94] Since the project revolves around public streets, it is appropriate to quote the definition of “Street” provided in this code “_2.25 Street—Any means of access, namely, highway, street, lane, pathway, alley, stairway, passageway, carriageway, footway, square, place or bridge, whether a thoroughfare or not, over which the public have a rite of passage or access or have passed and had access uninterruptedly for a specified period, whether existing or proposed in any scheme and includes all bunds, channels, ditches, storm-water drains, culverts, sidewalks, traffic islands, roadside trees and hedges, retaining walls, fences, barriers and railings within the street lines_.” In this connection, a reference to 4.3.2 Footpaths and Pathways can be made. “4.3.2.1.2 _The footpath shall be level, non-slip and continuous, and shall be provided with tactile orientation, kerb and kerb ramp. The footpath shall comply with the requirements given in B-2 other than for width which shall be as per 4.3.2.1.1_.” Part 13 “_Requirements for Accessibility in Built Environment for Elders and Persons with Disabilities_” contains comprehensive norms and rules about barrier-free environment and accessibility for persons with disabilities. Its focus is on a variety of disabilities such as non-ambulatory and ambulatory disabilities, sight disabilities, hearing disabilities, disabilities of in-coordination, ageing, allergies, heart and lung diseases, epilepsy, haemophilia, incontinence, enterostomy, etc.

For this purpose, this part defines ‘ability’ as well as ‘disability’. For defining disability, it quotes verbatim from the International Classification of Functions[^95] thereby espousing the view that disability has to be seen in continuum and every person may have one or more impairments. But some impairments are perceived negatively by society resulting in disability. Thus, the code tries to balance social and interactionist models of disability by showing sensitivity, both to disability and impairment and to the resulting adverse impact on functioning. The code by focusing on functioning links it with requirements of accessibility. The more the built-in environment is sensitive to multiple disabilities, the more accessible it is as a whole, for the entire community. In a way the, code challenges the dichotomy of disabled and non-disabled. To highlight some concrete provisions pertaining to ‘walkways and pathways’ which is the focus of this report, the code provides in B 2.2 that walkways are required to be “_Walkways shall be smooth, hard and have levelled surface suitable for walking and wheeling, in regular surfaces as cobble stones, coarsely exposed aggregate concrete, bricks, etc, often cause bumpy rides and shall be avoided.” To substantiate this general principle / norm the code contains hosts of technical rules of measurements dealing with width and breadth of the walkways_”.

Apart from the technical rules, the Code further emphasises in B-2.2.1,

“_g) When walkways exceed 60 m in length, it is desirable to provide rest area adjacent to the walk at convenient intervals of 30 m in the form of benches resting seats. For comfort, seat height shall be between 450 mm and 500 mm. and the seating shall have a back rest and arm rests at “00 mm height. One side of seating may be without arm rest to address the transfer needs of persons with disabilities. A colour contrast should be provided around the seating area for ease of identification by persons with low vision_.”

This guideline is sensitive to older people.

“_h) Texture change in walkways adjacent to seating shall be provided for persons with vision impairment by means of warning blocks (see B-2.5_)

_j) Gratings and manholes should be avoided in walks._

_k) Walks or driveways shall have a non-slip surface. Care shall be taken to ensure that adjacent surface materials do not display different slip resistance characteristics, particularly at the edges of changes of level or gradients_.

_m) Such walks shall be of a continuing common surface not interrupted by steps or abrupt changes in level._

_n) Wherever walks cross other walks, driveways, or parking lots. the', shall blend to a common level._

_p) Obstacles, such as objects or signs mounted on walls, columns or free-standing supports along the walking path shall be avoided. These shall however be regulated in accordance with B-2.6.1. Bollards along or on the walking pathway shall also be regulated in accordance with B-2.6.1. Any protruding object projecting into a walkway\\ shall be treated in accordance with B-2.6.2_"

The code also extensively deals with warning signals and obligates avoidance of hazards for persons with disabilities and the elderly. In this relevant part, it reads;

“_B-2.6.5 Warning Signals_

_Following requirements with respect to warning signals near barriers shall be complied with: a) Audible warning signals shall be accompanied by simultaneous visual signals for the benefit of those with hearing disabilities._

_b) Visual signals shall be accompanied by simultaneous audible signals for the benefit of the blind and visually impaired people. To assist blind people lettering and symbols on signs should be raised for tactile reading._

_c) Information based on colour codes only should be avoided; colour blind people may find them difficult to understand._

_d) Signs should be designed, located and illuminated as per B-24_.”

_B-2.6.6 Hazards_

_B-2.6.6.1 Where hazards on the direct line of pedestrian travel such as stairs, escalators and moving walks or ramps with a slope of more than 1:16 cannot be avoided, tactile warning indicators and visual markings shall be provided. Every effort shall be exercised to obviate hazards to persons with disabilities._

_B-2.6.6.2 Access panels in walls or manholes in walks, may be extremely hazardous, particularly when in use/ open, and shall be avoided. When manholes or access panels are open and in use. or when an open excavation exists on a site, particularly when it is in proximity of normal pedestrian traffic, barricades shall be placed on all open sides, and warning devices shall be installed_.”

The Code also has provisions for the observance of standards of lighting the walkways and pathways; these standards are particularly to be observed to enhance the accessibility of streets in respect of elderly people and persons with non-visual disabilities.[^96]

The Code has explicitly referred to planning a barrier-free environment 2011, a document prepared by the office of the Chief Commissioner of Persons with Disabilities, Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India. In this connection, a reference must also be made to the action plan for implementation of action points (2009-2011) identified by the Ministry for Urban Development for the empowerment of Persons with disabilities.[^97] Both these documents are important they are the source instruments to strengthen the enforcement of accessibility in the public realm.

Section 45 of The Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 reads _“appropriate Governments and the local authorities shall, within the limits to their economic capacity and development, provide for installation of auditory signals at red lights in public roads for the benefit of persons with visual handicap; curb cuts and slopes to be made in pavements for the easy access of wheel chair users; engraving on the surface of the zebra crossing for the blind or for persons with low vision; devising appropriate symbols of disability; warning signal at appropriate places; ramps in public buildings; adaptation of toilets for wheel chair users; Braille symbols and auditory signals in elevators or lifts; ramps in hospitals; primary health centres and other medical care and rehabilitation institutions_.”

Linkage of accessibility requirements with the fundamental right of freedom of movement and other allied freedoms can easily be characterised as the creation of rights-enabling conditions. The subjection of the same to economic capacity and development is therefore contrary to Article 19 of the Constitution of India. None of the freedoms therein can be restricted in respect of citizens on this ground, unlike the directive principles of state policy which are advisory and aspirational in nature. To reiterate standards outlined in part 4 of the Constitution, i.e., the Directive Principles of State policy are not per se enforceable in the court of law. Although their enforcement can be insisted by all levels of governance, they can invoke the justification of economic capacity and development to curtail the degree of the enforcement of these standards. On the other hand, fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution of India are enforceable, save as restrictions provided therein, their scope cannot be confined to by the Central and State legislatures by invoking the justification of economic capacity and development. It also smacks of perfunctory and ableist adherence to the letter and spirit of the UNCRPD. The same is evident from accessibility litigation discussed in Part 4.2. Transport.

The code does not make frequent references to the recommendations of the Indian Road Congress. However, since the Indian Road Congress is one of the participating bodies for the creation of this code, it is possible to argue that the drafting of the code was influenced by its recommendations of Indian Road Congress.

**Guidelines for Pedestrian Facilities, (First Revision) Indian Road Congress, 2012**

For evolving the best practices for enhancement of pedestrian facilities for disabled and elderly, reference must be made to Guidelines for Pedestrian Facilities, (first Revision) Indian Road Congress, 2012\. While effecting the revision, apart from the induction of a disabled access auditor Ms. Anjali Agarwal in the revision committee, wide consultations were also made with Disability Peoples organisation like Samrthyan, National Centre for Accessible Environments. The draft document prepared by the sub-group on accessibility was approved by the Urban Roads, Streets and Transport Committee in 2011, the Highway Specifications and Standard Committee 2011, and finally by the India Road Congress Committee 2011\. These guidelines are specially prepared to be used by the local authorities responsible for the construction and maintenance of roads and cover engineering, designing, and planning aspects of pedestrian facilities. Issues related to pedestrian safety audits are also highlighted in these guidelines. The guidelines adopt an inclusive approach and amplify to attach significance to the mobility and safety of all the pedestrians including persons with disabilities and persons with reduced mobility. In order to design a footpath to facilitate pedestrians, the guidelines identify six parameters vis-a-vis physical surface and three parameters as user factors.[^98]

**Physical parameters**

The six characteristics of the physical surface of the footpath to be paid attention to, are footpath width (wide enough to accommodate pedestrian flow at any given point of time), footpath surface (surfaces should be without cracks, bumps, stable, firm, slip-resistant), obstruction (obstructions should be on one side of the footpath to give clear walkway and particularly protruding obstructions like trees, garbage bin, hoardings, etc. should be avoided), encroachment (adequate spaces should be provided in the design of the footpath for informal commercial activities considering local conditions specific to India), the potential of vehicular conflict (footpath design to be raised, segregated and with guardrails) and the continuity (to avoid frequent ups and downs and to maintain the continuity surface kerb ramps should be in place).

**User parameters**

The three factors affecting pedestrian user facilities to which attention to be paid are volume of pedestrians, security (adequate street light, police patrolling during night time, sufficient activities on surrounding areas, segregated vehicular and pedestrian traffic)[^99], comfort (provisions for chairs/ benches, rain shelter and washroom[^100]. The location of trees to be carefully planned along with the environment (footpath to be clean and free from stink).

According to the guidelines, the conception of the level of service for pedestrians is ideal where the ideal pedestrian conditions exist and the factors negatively affecting the pedestrian level of service are minimal, whereas the level of service is acceptable when the basic pedestrian conditions exist but a small number of factors impact pedestrian safety and comfort.

A close look at the above parameters demonstrates that although the characteristics are progressive, the conditions identified for achieving the ideal/acceptable level of service of pedestrian facilities sound ableist in the absence of clear reference to use of tactile strips, auditory signals, etc. However, while dealing with ‘design standards of pedestrian facilities’, significance is attached to the adequate width of walking zone and footpath, use of tactile considering the needs of different users. The focus on adequate width is to accommodate wheelchair users and persons with vision impairments who are assisted by a sighted person or guide dog.

**Harmonised Guidelines and Space standards and barrier-free built environment for persons with disability and Elderly persons (Feb 2016\)**

In this connection, a reference may also be made to suggestions and recommendations on Road Planning (particularly Side Walks/ footpaths, Kerb Ramps at Walkways and Pedestrian Crossings, Road Intersections, Traffic Signals, Subways and Foot Over Bridges) adopted through these guidelines. These guidelines are significant in giving teeth to the mandate of Section 45 of the PWD Act and empower both the Central and State Governments to issue secondary legislation.[^101]

1\. Guidelines and Space Standards for Barrier-Free Built Environment for Disabled and Elderly Persons, CPWD, 1998;

2\. Manual on Barrier-Free Environment, MSJE, 2002;

3.Annex D, National Building Code, Bureau of Indian Standards, 2005[^102] were harmonized by the Ministry of Urban Development with the guidance of the Central Coordination Committee constituted under the provisions of the Persons with Disabilities Act 1995\. Together they are cited as the Harmonised Guidelines and Space standards and barrier free built environment for persons with disability and Elderly persons (Feb 2016).

The National building code 2005 has been referred to mainly because it is one of the three codes/ guidelines mentioned above which have been harmonised by way of these guidelines in Feb 2016\. These harmonised guidelines are also relevant because they have been relied upon in the preparation of the National Building Code, 2016.[^103]

To an extent, these guidelines may sound under representative as their focus is mainly on seven[^104] disabilities falling within categories established by the Persons with Disabilities Act 1995\. Nevertheless, they deserve a reference because according to experts these guidelines are far more progressive than the earlier manual on Barrier-Free Environment, MSJE, 2002 prepared by the Chief Commissioner of Persons with Disabilities.

In order to facilitate pedestrian movement for PWDs and the elderly, the following suggestions have been made in the guidelines;

**11.1 Sidewalks / Footpaths**

The Sidewalk should: \-

Have non-slip floor surface;

Be along the entire length of the road;

Be not more than 150mm high;

Be at least 1800 mm wide;

Have tactile guiding blocks for persons with visual impairments;

Preferably have well-defined edges of paths and routes by use of different colours and textures; \- Have no obstacles or projections along the pathway. If this is unavoidable, there should be clear headroom of at least 2000 mm from the floor level;

Have kerb cuts complying with Section 7.1 where ever a person is expected to walk into or off the pathway; and

Have tactile warning blocks installed next to all entry and exit points from the pathway.

Guidelines also emphasize the construction of ramps at Walkways and Pedestrian Crossings (point 11\)

Kerb ramp at pedestrian crossing should be wholly contained in the area designated for pedestrians use (Figure 11-1). At the pedestrian crossings, i.e., for the kerb ramps, tactile floor guidance should be provided. Zebra crossings should be in 3D texture to be easily detectable by persons with visual impairments.

**Road Intersections**

Pedestrian crossings should be equipped with traffic control signal;

Constructing traffic islands to reduce the length of the crossing is recommended for the safety of all road users;

Guide strips should be constructed to indicate the position of pedestrian crossings for the benefit of people with visual impairments;

Road bumps help reduce the speed of traffic approaching the intersection.

**11.5 Traffic signals**

Pedestrian traffic lights should be provided with clearly audible signals for the benefit of pedestrians with visual impairments;

Acoustic devices should be installed on a pole at the point of origin of crossing and not at the point of destination;

The installation of two adjacent acoustic devices such as beepers is not recommended to avoid disorientation;

The time interval allowed for crossing should be programmed according to the slowest crossing persons; and

Acoustical signals encourage safer crossing behaviour among children as well.

**11.6 Subways and Foot Over Bridges**

Subways and foot over bridges should be accessible for people with disabilities.

This may be achieved by:

Provision of signage at a strategic location;

Provision of slope ramps or lifts at both the ends to enable wheelchair accessibility;

Ensuring that the walkway is at least 1500 mm wide;

Provision of tactile guiding and warning blocks along the length of the walkway;

Keeping the walkway; free from any obstructions and projections; and

Providing seats for people with ambulatory disabilities at regular intervals along the walkway and landings. Another notable development in this connection is the evolution of Model Building Bye-Laws 2016, revised in 2016 and Published by the Ministry of Urban Development, Government of India. The underlying objective of this instrument is to raise the consciousness of provinces and union territories about Barrier-Free Environment.

There is a dedicated chapter called ‘Norms for differently abled, senior citizens and children (Chapter 8)’. These byelaws serve as model legislation for the states and union territories and all the aforementioned instruments of accessibility have been incorporated in this byelaw. Unfortunately, although these byelaws briefly allude to the accessibility of internal roads, there is no discussion about pedestrian streets/ roads in general.

**Legal Efficacy**

A careful look at all the above instruments makes it clear that these are soft law instruments that are predominantly recommendatory in nature and per se do not have any legal consequences. To enforce these instruments, they would have to be explicitly adopted by the states through notifications or legislation. Although most of these instruments copiously refer to UNCRPD there is stoic silence in all these instruments about taking cognizance of the proposed bills in the parliament envisaging revision of PWD Act, 1995.[^105] What is even more surprising is the complete omission on the part of the Parliament of India in taking cognizance of these instruments either in the preamble of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 or in its relevant provisions on accessibility.

**Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016**

To add to this legal perplexity, Section 40 obligates the Central Government to formulate rules for persons with disabilities laying down the standards of accessibility for the physical environment, transportation, information, and communications, including appropriate technologies and systems, and other facilities and services provided to the public in urban and rural areas in consultation with Chief Commissioner.

Section 44 then goes on to mandate the observance of accessibility of norms by providing “(1) No establishment shall be granted permission to build any structure if the building plan does not adhere to the rules formulated by the Central Government under Section 40\. (2) No establishment shall be issued a certificate of completion or allowed to take occupation of a building unless it has adhered to the rules formulated by the Central Government”. Moreover, Section 45 in its relevant part stipulates the time limits within which to comply with the norms of accessibility in respect of existing infrastructure. It reads “(1) All existing public buildings shall be made accessible in accordance with the rules formulated by the Central Government within a period not exceeding five years from the date of notification of such rules: Provided that the Central Government may grant an extension of time to the States on a case-to-case basis for adherence to this provision depending on their state of preparedness and other related parameters.”

Complying with Section 40, the Central government enacted rules pertaining to accessibility standards i.e., rules 15 and 16 in 2017\. In its relevant part

“_15\. Rules for Accessibility…. (2) The respective Ministries and Departments shall ensure compliance of the standards of accessibility specified under this rule through the concerned domain regulators or otherwise.”_

The relevant part of Rule 15 _(1) (a) (1) provides “Every establishment shall comply with the following standards relating to physical environment, transport and information and communication technology, namely: \- (a) standard for public buildings as specified in the Harmonised Guidelines and Space Standards for Barrier Free Built Environment for Persons with Disabilities and Elderly Persons as issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Urban Development in March 2016……_.”After reading both the rules together, it may be argued that the Ministry of Urban Development was mandated to enact the revised guidelines for pedestrian facilities in the context of barrier-free environment for PWDs within six months of coming into force of these rules. Some of these guidelines may be useful for elderly people as well. This argument is further strengthened with a reference to Section 41 (1) (c) and (2). “_Section 41 (1) (c) provides_

_(1) The appropriate Government shall take suitable measures to provide, —_

_(c) accessible roads to address mobility necessary for persons with disabilities._

_(2) The appropriate Government shall develop schemes programmes to promote the personal mobility of persons with disabilities at affordable cost to provide for…………_

(c) personal mobility assistance”

It appears that the Ministry has not framed any such guidelines and the focus is still on the harmonized guidelines of 2016 and the National Building Code 2016 whose reference point is the 1995 Act. Taking into account the widened ambit of the RPWD Act 2016 with its coverage of 21 disabilities compared with only 7 under the PWD Act, 1995, we wonder if the said inaction of the Government signals regression. Strangely, although Section 41 (1) (c) and (2) are couched in mandatory language the obligation arising out of the same may become inexecutable lest the harmonized guidelines are perceived as recognized accessibility standards of the Government of India and endorsed by the Chief Commissioner of Persons with Disabilities. To our knowledge, there is hardly any court litigation involving enforcement of Section 44 of the RPWD Act, 2016\. Moreover, it also has to be highlighted that the RPWD Act, 2016 being UNCRPD ratifying law, the mandate of Section 44 must generate spillover effect right until the town planning of every state.

#### **_A4.1.3 Disability_**

**National level strategy**

In India, there is no general disability strategy. However, the Government of India has adopted the National Policy for persons with Disabilities 2006\. Although this policy is informed by the Right to equality and liberty as part of an entrenched Bill of Rights under the Constitution of India, it does not allude to the UNCRPD, probably because it was adopted prior to the entry into force of the UNCRPD. The policy, apart from amplifying a non-handicapping environment also engages with the creation of a barrier-free environment. One of the policy statements is dedicated to; **_“V. Barrier-free environment_**

_33\. Barrier-free environment enables people with disabilities to move about safely and freely, and use the facilities within the built environment. The goal of a barrier-free design is to provide an environment that supports the independent functioning of individuals so that they can participate without assistance, in everyday activities. Therefore, to the maximum extent possible, buildings/ places/transportation systems for public use will be made barrier-free_.”[^106] The Government has evolved some general strategies (Principal Areas of Intervention) to comply with the aforementioned statements. The relevant part is reproduced hereunder; _“VI. Barrier-free environment: For creation of barrier-free environment, the following strategies will be adopted: (i) Public buildings (functional or recreational), transport amenities including roads, sub-ways and pavements, railway platforms, bus-stops / terminals, ports, airports, modes of transports (bus, train, plane and waterways), playgrounds, open space etc. will be made accessible. (iii) Modification of Curriculum of Architects and Civil engineers will be undertaken to include issues relating to construction of barrier-free buildings. In service training will be provided on these issues to the government architects and engineers. (v) Full adoption of comprehensive building byelaws and space standards for barrier-free built environment shall be ensured. Effort will be made to ensure adoption of the byelaws and space standards by all the states, municipal bodies and Panchayati Raj institutions in the country. These authorities will ensure that all newly constructed buildings for public use are barrier-free. (vi) State Transport Undertakings will ensure disabled friendly features in their vehicles. Railways will provide barrier-free coaches in a phased manner. They will also make the platforms-buildings, toilets and other facilities barrier-free. (ix) All the buildings, which are for public use, will be audited for its accessibility to persons with disability. There may be a need to develop professionally recognized access auditors whose services would be utilized for the purpose_”.[^107]

Some of the other policy statements are related to Prevention of Disabilities, Rehabilitation Measures, Women with disabilities, Children with disabilities, Issue of Disability Certificates, social security, Promotion of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), Collection of regular information on Persons with Disabilities, Research, Sports, Recreation and Cultural life, Amendments to existing Acts dealing with the Persons with Disabilities.

#### **_A4.1.4 Older People_**

Under the Constitution of India, there is a specific and aspirational commitment, in respect of older people under Article 41, one of the Directive Principles of State Policy. See Section A 1\. Against the backdrop of UN General Assembly Resolution 47/5 to observe the year 1999 as the International Year of older persons, the Government of India adopted National policy on Older persons in 1999\.

However, the focus of this policy was on health care, under the impression of older people being weak and vulnerable. Although primarily the focus of the policy was to guard old people against vulnerability, it also highlighted the issue of productive ageing and recognized the constructive role of older people emphasizing that they are able to live with purpose and dignity at the far end of their lives. Apart from the government, the policy also identities NGOs and families as channels to nurture and care for older people. The policy recognized that the concerns of older people are national concerns and they are not to be exposed to unprotected, ignored, and marginalized life.

A high-power committee was constituted by the Government of India, relook at the issues around old age and to reflect and introspect the 1999 policy. After several rounds of in-depth interaction and discussions with stakeholders and the government, the committee submitted the National Policy of Senior Citizens, 2010 which has been subsequently adopted by the Government in 2011\.

A number of international instruments pertaining to human rights of elderly people viz. the Proclamation on Ageing and the global targets on ageing adopted by the General Assembly in 1992 – 2001, The Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing, 2002, the Shanghai Plan of action 2002, and the Macau Outcome document 2007 adopted by UNESCAP have been signed by India and the same has influenced a great deal in the adoption of National Policy of Senior Citizens 2011\. At the national level, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment coordinates programmes to be undertaken by other Ministers in their relevant areas of support to older persons. In one of the areas of intervention, i.e., Housing, there is a brief reference to a barrier-free environment in this policy: “_27\. Age Friendly, barrier free access will be created in buses and bus stations, railways and railway stations, airport and bus transportation within the airports, banks hospitals, places of worship, cinema halls, shopping malls and other public places that senior citizens and the disabled frequent_”.[^108]

At the Central Governmental level too, there is a visible impact of both these policies viz. an obligation on the Ministry of Railway to provides ramps at the entry points of the railway stations, and specially designed and accessible coaches for older people and PWDs. There is also a provision for allotment of lower berth to older and PWDs on a preferential basis.

### **A4.2 Transport**

Article 9 of the UNCRPD inter alia recognizes the right to accessible transportation of persons with disabilities.

A close look at the Constitution of India vis-à-vis transportation reveals that the domain is complexly divided between the Centre and the states. Predominantly, the Centre has the most powers to make laws dealing with different facets of air, sea, and road transport under List I.[^109] Subject to the power of the Centre under List 1 through a different legislative entry,[^110] the provinces have powers to make laws under Entry 13 of List II. Under List III, i.e., concurrent List, both the Centre and Provinces can make laws on certain aspects of transportation[^111] subject to the condition that, in case of a conflict between the legislation enacted by the Centre and the States, the former will prevail unless the latter is provided special assent by the President.[^112] However, interestingly, the subject matter of disability is occupied by the Parliament being legislation to incorporate the UNCRPD, and since the power to enact laws to incorporate an international treaty is in the exclusive domain of the parliament, a question arises whether transportation vis-s-vis disability is subject to the principle of federalism as seen above? Or whether the matters connected with transportation vis-à-vis disability being covered by the UNCRPD and allied international treaties, the same be dealt with by the Parliament alone, being the exclusive repository of authority in the said domain as mentioned above, is a critical question. Till the date of writing this report, we have not come across any litigation where provinces have raised an objection based on federalism in respect of transportation and disability. Besides, freedom of movement being one of the important freedoms safeguarded by Article 19(1)(d), it goes without saying that, till means of transportation are made accessible for PWDs, this freedom is bound to remain an empty formality for them. It is therefore plausible to argue that the principle of accessibility is, in a real sense, the enabler to propel this freedom vis-à-vis PWDs and older people. It also goes without saying that in the light of the constitutionally entrenched values of equality and dignity, PWDs and older people have the right to enjoy this freedom equally with others.

The above discussion, therefore, makes it clear that the obligation of the executive and legislature in safeguarding this freedom is not merely passive, i.e., negative but also active i.e., by way of positive duties to enable the transportation vis-à-vis PWDs and older people by going for retrofitting in respect of existing means of transport and allied aspects of transportation or going for a universal and accessible design, suitable for all sections of the society including PWDs and older people. On this background, it would be appropriate to have a brief look at the provision of the RPWD Act, 2016 dealing with transportation. The term ‘transportation system’ has been defined under the RPWD Act, 2016 very broadly. In Section 2 (zd) it reads “_transportation systems” includes road transport, rail transport, air transport, water transport, para transit systems for the last mile connectivity, road and street infrastructure, etc.”_ The words ‘include’ and ‘etc.’ in this definition make it evident that the Parliament intends to keep the notion of transport system open-ended so that all its modes and aspects are made accessible vis-à-vis disability. To fully utilise the broad scope of this definition, we must read this definition alongside the definitions of barrier, universal design, and public facilities and services. The term barrier is defined in Section 2 (c). It reads _“barrier’’ means any factor including communicational, cultural, economic, environmental, institutional, political, social, attitudinal or structural factors which hampers the full and effective participation of persons with disabilities in society_”.

Universal design is defined under Section 2 (ze). It reads “_universal design” means the design of products, environments, programmes and services to be usable by all people to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialised design and shall apply to assistive devices including advanced technologies for particular group of persons with disabilities._” Section 2 (x) defines “_public facilities and services” to include “all forms of delivery of services to the public at large, including…………. Transportation._”

A close look at these definitions demonstrates that, for the design of products and services to be usable by all in the domain of transport, environmental and structural factors play an important role. If these factors do not remain sensitive to diversity and merely take into account the needs and requirements of the able-bodied, then the policy of the government cannot be said to be in furtherance with either the letter and spirit of the UNCRPD or the RPWD Act. To make transportation inclusive and usable by all, the policymakers have to eliminate the attitudinal deficit and show the necessary willpower to abandon the ableist perspective. A paradigm shift is also necessary in political processes to push ahead the agenda of inclusive transportation and there should be preparedness to offset the additional costs with its effective utility by excluded sections of society including PWDs and older persons. This is the point that is amplified with the Parliamentary recognition of transportation as one of the facets of public facilities. With the same, the idea that public spaces belong to all, irrespective of diversity, is galvanised. In other words, the provision for accessible transportation and recognition of transport as one of the public facilities, are rights enabling conditions for effective enforcement of RPWD Act, 2016 and to get rid of ableist domination of public spaces. Recognising the interface of the right to education with accessible transport for PWDs Section 16 (viii) mandates the governments at both the Central and Provincial levels and local and self-government authorities to provide transportation facilities to children with disabilities, and also attendants/carers of the children with disabilities having high-support needs to promote their inclusive education. Read alongside Article 21- A of the Constitution of India guaranteeing the right to free and compulsory education to all children, non-compliance of the obligation under Section 16 (viii) shall result in violation of the fundamental right to receive free and compulsory education by Children with Disabilities. Warranting issuance of the appropriate writ and directions by the Constitutional courts are covered under Articles 226 and 32 of the Constitution of India. Besides, the RPWD Act, 2016 has dedicated provisions i.e., Section 40 to ensure accessibility in transportation. Section 41 obligates the governments at both Central and Provincial level and local and self-government authorities to provide _“(a) facilities for persons with disabilities at bus stops, railway stations and airports conforming to the accessibility standards relating to parking spaces, toilets, ticketing counters and ticketing machines; (b) access to all modes of transport that conform the design standards, including retrofitting old modes of transport, wherever technically feasible and safe for persons with disabilities, economically viable and without entailing major structural changes in design; (c) accessible roads to address mobility necessary for persons with disabilities_”. The duty is also cast upon the governments at both Central and Provincial level and local and self-government authorities to prepare scheme and programs _“to promote the personal mobility of persons with disabilities at affordable cost to provide for, — (a) incentives and concessions; (b) retrofitting of vehicles; and (c) personal mobility assistance_”.

The structure of Section 41 (1) is extremely complex. From one perspective, the duty cast on the government to take appropriate measures to provide accessible transport may be characterised as structural and anticipatory. However, in absence of any provision to visit its non-compliance, and with the usage of terminology like ‘suitable measures,’ it may also sound aspirational or declaratory. However, the use of the term ‘shall’ complicates the matter and one may perceive non-compliance with this duty as a breach of public function warranting issuance of writs and directions from the Constitutional Courts under Articles 226 and 32 of the Constitution of India.

On the other hand, from the standpoint of the analytical jurisprudence, this duty may be characterised as the correlative of the right to the accessibility of PWDs though the right is not explicitly conferred by this provision by using the doctrine of implication. The right duty correlation can be then enforced both in civil and Constitutional courts depending upon the nature and gravity of non-compliance. However, this matter is further compounded by Section 89 prescribing penalties for contravention of the provisions of this Act and visiting the same fine. This section gives rise to an interesting question – Is the fine on an individual an appropriate relief for the breach/non-compliance of administrative duties cast on all the levels of government. In want of judicial pronouncement on this point, one can only speculate that the non-compliance of administrative and structural duty cannot be confused with contravention of provisions of RPWD Act, 2016 by individuals. Generally, in India for administrative non-compliance, personal liability is not invoked. Normatively, the Ministry of Road Transport is mandated to both at Central and Provincial levels to play a pivotal role in attaining the objectives underlying the aforementioned provisions. For the same under Section 60 (2) and 66(2), the Secretaries to the Government of India and Provinces to the Ministry of Road Transport respectively are made ex-officio members at Central and State Advisory boards. It is also interesting to compare the accessibility regime vis-à-vis transportation and roads under the PWD Act, 1995\. Under the former, the accessibility of roads and transport is dealt with in a single section i.e., 41 whereas, under the latter, matters of transportation and roads have dedicated sections i.e., 44 and 45\. The headings of the sections under the PWD Act, 1995 were Non-discrimination on the road and Non-discrimination in transport indicating non-discrimination which cast an obligation on both the Central and Provincial levels and local and self-government authorities. Under the RPWD Act, 2016, the heading of Section 41 is Access to transport. It is striking that the heading is not couched in either the language of obligation or rights. We emphasise headings because in India while interpreting statutes in order to resolve ambiguities, to clarify any terms employed in a section, or to understand the context of the section, courts do rely on the headings to the sections.

Another important difference between the accessibility regimes vis-à-vis transportation and roads in the RPWD Act, 2016 and the PWD Act, 1995 is that the former while obligating all forms of the government to take suitable measure to provide accessible transport and roads for persons with disabilities do not limit its nature by conditionality of economic capacity and development, whereas under the1995 regime did. It is, therefore, possible to argue that the nature of duty under the RPWD Act, 2016 vis-à-vis accessible transportation and road can be construed as categorical. Of course, this observation is qualified by and subject to our speculation expressed above, about the nature of this obligation.

Last but not least in terms of details, the PWD Act, 1995 regime was more articulate mentioning the measures to be taken for accessibility in comparison with RPWD Act, 2016\. However, the same is not very significant because, unlike PWD Act, 1995, under RPWD Act, 2016, a substantive obligation is cast on the Central Government to lay down the standards of accessibility in consultation with the Chief Commissioner of Disability through rules to be made under the Act. Although we find the obligation to be very appropriate, the mechanism created for the attainment of the obligation appears to be half-hearted as it is assumed that the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities has institutional competence to suggest and recommend the accessibility standards. In our opinion, the subject matter of accessibility being a specialised area of knowledge, it would have been more appropriate had the Parliament envisaged an accessibility board consisting of access auditors and allied experts.

**The Motor Vehicle Act, 1988**

The Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 (MV Act) has made some progressive changes indicating sensitivity to the social model of disability by way of example – a reference to the usage of ‘invalid vehicles’ in the earlier law is now substituted by ‘adapted vehicle’; this change shows the sensitivity to universal design. Similarly, a new sub-section 1-A is inserted in Section 138 empowering the State Government – To make rules for the purposes of regulating the activities and access of non-mechanically propelled vehicles and pedestrians to public places and national highways. As a consequence of this new section, the Provincial governments are obligated to put in place pedestrian policies. However, the omission of PWDs from this section is significant. The Act continues to be regressive in perpetuating the assumption, that PWDs if allowed to drive vehicles, pose a danger to the public at large.

**National Urban Transport Policy (Revised in 2014\)**

Reference may also be made to the National Urban Transport Policy (Revised in 2014)[^113]. The objective of this policy is to plan for the people rather than vehicles by providing sustainable mobility and accessibility to all citizens to jobs, education, social services, and recreation at affordable cost and within a reasonable time. This policy has a dedicated segment to address ‘universal accessibility’. “Universal accessibility is an approach that covers everyone so that the transport services: (1) be used fairly; (2) provide a high degree of freedom; (3) be simple; (4) be easy to understand; (5) be safe; (6) shall not require unnecessary bodily strength, and (7) maintain an appropriate space and size that is easy to use.”[^114] Section 10 of the policy dealing with Non-Motorized Transport (NMT), attaches significance to accessible walking. Accessible pathways to walk apart from the enhancement of mobility of PWDs have the potential to reduce vehicular traffic. Unfortunately, a committee on NMT of Pune Municipal Corporation does not mandate representation of PWDs.

The policy also highlights a number of elements of accessibility like adequate width of footpath along the roads; tactile plates on the pavement, anti-skid paving at public transit station entry/exit gates; table-top road crossing facilities, ramps & lifts at FOBs, Signage supplemented with Braille & pictograms, pedestrian crossing facilities with lifts; etc.[^115] To attain the goal of the first mile to last mile connectivity the policy inter alia recognises “Design principles17 that improve pedestrian access to PT systems for all users should include safety, accessibility, reliability and affordability”.[^116] These elements have been acknowledged by the accessibility India campaign while rolling out its action plan. In this connection, a reference may also be made to the ‘Code of Practice for Bus Body Design Approval’ introduced in 2019 by Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (Department of Road Transport & Highways) Government of India. In its relevant Part, Chapter: 2 dealing with General Requirements of Bus Body Design states;

“2.2.19 Provisions for Differently Abled Passengers

2.2.19.1 All Type I buses shall have at least two passenger seats in case of Mini & Midi buses and four passenger seats in case of other buses designated as priority seats for persons with disabilities. These seats shall be only of the forward-facing type and preferably be located behind the driver’s seat.

2.2.19.2 The seats designated for Differently Abled Passengers shall be indicated with appropriate sign(s). An illustration of the signs to be provided above the priority seats is shown in Figure 16\.

2.2.19.3 The priority seats shall be provided with appropriate facility for securing the crutches, canes, walkers etc. to facilitate convenient travel for persons with disabilities.

2.2.19.4 Handrails and / or stanchions shall be provided at the entrance of all Type I buses in a configuration, which allows persons with disabilities to grasp such assists from outside the vehicle while starting to board, and to continue using such assists throughout the boarding process, until they reach the designated seating area. The dimensions of the hand rails shall be as per para 2.2.9.

2.2.19.5 All Type I NDX buses shall be provided with controls adjacent to priority seats for requesting stops and which alerts the driver that a mobility aid user wishes to disembark. Such a system shall provide auditory and visual indications to let the user know that the request has been made. Controls shall be mounted not higher than 1300 mm and now lower than 410 mm above the floor, shall be operable with one hand and shall not require tight grasping, pinching, or twisting of the wrist. The force required to activate controls shall not be greater than 2.2 kg.”[^117]

Though the guidelines look progressive whether they represent even the 21 disabilities mentioned in RPWD Act, 2016 is a matter of investigation. Moreover, the focus of guideline being physical structure of buses the aspect of sensitization of conductor or drivers of buses which is a cross-cutting issue is barely touched. Moreover, the guidelines being recommendatory they lack the sanctioning mechanism. The issue of the accessibility of buses and other transport vehicles is not directly relevant to this report. However, the information provided here sets the tone here for analysis of case laws.

**Accessible India Campaign:** To quote from the website of this campaign, _“Persons with disabilities have an equal right to travel and use public and private transportation infrastructure with dignity and independence. Accessible transportation plays a critical role in the growth of its economy. Inaccessible transportation system restricts mobility, denies freedom of movement and active participation, for much of the population who may need accessible transportation_.”[^118]

When we look at real-time use of popular modes of transport like rickshaws, taxis, buses and railways it becomes clear that by their design they are completely inaccessible for the PWDs, and in particular, the wheelchair-users find greater difficulties in the navigation through these modes.[^119] However, the policy does not shed much light on problematizing or altering the ableist vehicular design. By way of public interest litigation, a petition was filed in the year 2005 by a visually challenged activist to vindicate the right to accessibility.[^120] Till the year February 2019, the Supreme Court has passed as many as fifty-seven orders to supervise compliance/adherence of accessibility standards by the Central and Provincial governments, and Union territories in respect of airports, railway stations, and public transportation. Out of these fifty-seven orders, only some orders are worth the discussion as the same contains detailed directions. The details of the rest of the orders are provided in a separate annexure. Out of these two orders, the order dated 15/12/2017[^121] is the main judgment containing relevant directions and a timeline of targets of compliance, and the second order dated 15/01/2019 is virtually a statement of dissatisfaction on part of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court deprecated in this order, the lackadaisical attitude on the part of the central and provincial governments in not adhering to the directions and meeting the targets. To allude to the court “_We, therefore, take strong exception to the lacklustre attitude of the respondents. Last and final opportunity is given to all the States and the Union Territories to provide the information in the requisite tabular format in respect of all the targets and it should be complete in every respect which includes stipulation of targets dates as well. Needful be done_ _within three weeks_”.[^122] However, the first order which is a detailed judgment is relevant for our purpose. The Supreme Court of India in this order had issued a slew of directions to make international airports, railway, government-owned public transport carriers accessible.

To further allude to the court “_Accessibility in airports. Completing accessibility audit of all the international airports and making them fully accessible by December 2016\. The demand of the petitioner that the Civil Aviation Ministry should follow the prescribed template i.e., the IIT Roorkee template on the Government website appears to be justified which should be implemented as expeditiously as possible. The Union of India should thereafter conduct the accessibility and audit and upload the same on the website by June, 2018_.” _“50% of all railway stations to be made fully accessible by March 2018.”_ [^123] However, in respect of the other access issues like “_long term accessibility feature including the provision of the facility for inter-platform transfer and tactile flooring of the platform – Railing, parking for disabled, the non-slippery walkway from parking to Building, Signage, suitable drinking water facility, Accessible toilet at ground floor and ‘May I Help You’ booth, the Supreme Court was reluctant in prescribing any timeline and instead provided three months to the Railways to prepare an action plan to equip the railway stations with long terms facilities_.” Paradoxically, the Supreme Court also recognised “_insofar as providing of various facilities in the railway stations are concerned, which are listed by the petitioner, there cannot be any dispute that the Indian railways is statutorily obligated to make those provisions_”.[^124] In respect of public transport carriers relying on Section 41 of the RPWD Act, 2016 the court held _“10% of government-owned public transport carriers are to be made fully accessible by March 2018\. Here again, Section 41 of the RPWD Act, 2016 provides for comprehensive accessibility in all modes of transport including but not remitted to the bus transport. Therefore, it becomes the duty of the Union, States as well as Union Territories to ensure that all Government buses are disabled friendly in accordance with the Harmonized Guidelines. Likewise, the respondents are duty-bound to see that private buses also become disabled-friendly. Thus, we direct the Government to lay down the plan giving the dates by which the aforesaid task shall be undertaken_.” Again, the directions were toothless as the Supreme Court merely directed the government to lay down an action plan within three months rather than setting targets for it. By taking such a stance, the Supreme Court refused to make accessibility obligation timebound in spheres of the railway and public transport carriers. As is evident from its order dated 15/01/2019, largely all directions are being observed in the breach by the governments and the requisite information also has not been provided by the Respondents to the court. Apart from this litigation, at the provincial level too, there has been litigation to make public transportation accessible for PWDs. Earlier, a group of students from ILS Law College, Pune charged the State government, Pune Municipal Corporation, and the railway authorities in Pune for ignorance and non-compliance with the PWD Act, 1995 by filing a PIL in 2002.[^125] In this PIL, the group of students sought directions from the Bombay High Court against procurement of 100 Buses that were inaccessible to PWDs. Conceding to the Petitioners, the two-judge bench of the Bombay High Court had restrained the Pune Municipal Transport and Maharashtra State Road Transport from purchasing new buses. However, these salutary directions have by and large remained non-complied with.

On similar lines, a petition[^126] had been filed by another activist (Nipun Malhotra) in the Supreme Court, challenging the decision of Delhi Transport Corporation to buy 2000 standard-floor buses instead of low-floor buses for the national capital. Allowing the petition, the Supreme Court in 2019 mandated low-floor buses to be purchased in Delhi. Again, in terms of the degree with compliance of this direction, the situation is not very happy.[^127] In another petition, Integrated Disabled Employees' Association (I.D.E.A.) v. State of West Bengal[^128] to make the bus transport in west Bengal disabled friendly and accessible. Upon hearing both the parties the Calcutta High Court issued the following directions; (a) that memorandum dated 16 May, 2003 allowing certain categories of physically challenged persons including visually impaired persons have been allowed to travel free of cost with a companion in all State Transport buses to be scrupulously observed by all concerned; (b) that provisions made in Rule 233(2) of the West Bengal Motor Vehicles Rules with respect to reservation of two seats for the blind and/or for orthopedically or congenially handicapped persons in the Stage Carriage Vehicles shall also be observed; (c) that there shall not be any harassment to any disabled persons and they shall be allowed to enjoy the facilities that the State Government considered increasing of one more seat in the vehicles which not provided by Rule 233(2) and also consider the proposal for running special buses for physically challenged persons and the reservation be provided in each and every vehicle as ordered by the State Government and as envisaged in the Rule 233(2) of the West Bengal Motor Vehicles Rules. So far as implementation of the mandate of Section 45 of the PWD Act of 1995 is concerned the court left it to the discretion of the authorities and made an unusual observation by asking the State of West Bengal to explore the possibility of launching special-disabled friendly buses on the important roads and the buses exclusively for disabled and physically challenged persons within three months from the judgment.

In yet another significant case, Jeeja Ghosh v. Union of India[^129], the Supreme Court came down very heavily on the aviation industry for being insensitive to the dignity of PWDs. In the instant case Jeeja Ghosh, renowned disability rights activists and a person with Cerebral Palsy had been forcibly deplaned by the captain of the airliner due to her atypical stature and disability. Apart from awarding compensation of INR 10,00,000/- to Ms. Ghosh, the court also issued a number of directions to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation to comply with the report of the Ashok Committee recommending necessary modification in the Civil Aviation Rules in 2008\. Based on the same, the Civil Aviation Rules 2014 were adopted. Inter alia the committee had recommended that “the definition of persons with reduced mobility should include such persons who require assistance in air travel, for example, persons with hearing and vision impairment, persons with autism, etc., who have no visible impairment but still require facilitation at the airport and in the aircraft.” The Committee also suggested standardization of training, standard operating procedures, need for sufficient oversight by authorities, need for clarity on the requirement of medical clearance by passengers, standardization of equipment at airports and on aircraft, proper training of security checking personnel, and the need for more clarity on seating arrangement to PRMs. It was also suggested that kerb side assistance kiosks should be mandated, and guidelines should be issued on the provision of priority tags for passengers on wheelchairs. A recommendation was made for mandating the location of dedicated parking space at airports and for the accessibility of an in-flight entertainment system. Safety briefings in aircraft should also be made in sign language for persons who are hard of hearing/deaf. It should also cover the emergency evacuation of blind passengers. The report highlights international best practices on interaction with persons with disabilities, covering separately the interaction with the blind, the deaf, and persons with a mobility disability, etc. It also covers in detail the training procedure, including initial and recurrent training. Significant recommendations include the following;

1. Revision of CAR on Carriage by Air of Persons with Disabilities in a time-bound manner. Ensure compliance of recommendations within 3 years at major airports and then at other airports in a phased manner.

2. Address a suggested funding mechanism for meeting the cost of implementation.

3. Define allocation of responsibilities for airlines, airports, and others for their respective roles in providing facilities to persons with disabilities.

4. Standardisation of equipment like wheelchairs and facilities designed for PRMs.

5. Establishment of Standard Operating Procedures for all service providers and adequate training of their staff.

6. Web-enabled booking, in-flight briefing, and evacuation of such persons.

7. Implement a mechanism for grievance redressal.

8. Airlines and airports declare their policy on facilities provided to PRMs by publishing on their respective websites. The Court noted that “_though most of the recommendations are accepted, there is some tweaking done by the Government and some of the suggestions of the Committee are not incorporated in the revised CAR, 2014\.”[^130]_ In certain respects, the guidelines can be further fine-tuned by the official respondents, keeping in view the recommendations of the committee where they have not been fully implemented. Accordingly, the court drew the attention of the Director-General of Civil Aviation and the ministry towards incorporation following aspects highlighted by the committee amendments to Civil Aviation Rules 2014\.

1) Procurement of standardized assistive devices in consultation with the department of disability affairs.

1) Setting up of fully accessible help desk to receive requests from passengers with disabilities.

1) Passenger should be allowed to retain the use of their wheelchairs

1) Detailed procedure for security check by Central Industrial Security Force.

1) Communication of essential information concerning flight should be provided in accessible formats to the passengers with disabilities.

1) Detailed procedure for redressal of complaints at the airport

1) Training and sensitization of the staff and security personnel at the airport and on an airliner.

When these directions are matched with present ground realities, it can be safely concluded that amongst different domains of transportations, airports in India are the most compliant so far as the accessibility requirements of PWDs are concerned. Though the problem of wheelchair-bound passengers persists even now, there is hardly any sensitivity to provide necessary information at the airport and on-board airliner, in sign language. Based on our practical experience, we would venture to place on record the root cause for lack of empathy towards PWDs vis-à-vis air travel has more to do with the negative attitude than the lack of infrastructure or accessibility.

Similarly, in Javed Abidi v. Union of India,[^131] the petitioner had sought a number of directions to the Indian Airlines viz. immediately providing for aisle chairs in every aircraft, ambulift on all the Airports of the country, and direct the Indian Airlines to provide 50% concession to all the disabled persons as defined in Section 2(1) of the PWD Act, 1995\.

With regard to the first two directions, the court found it unnecessary to intervene as it conquered the stand of the Indian Airlines. Whereas in respect of concessional tickets the court allowed the contention of the petitioner partially and directed Indian Airlines to extend the same concession to persons with locomotive disability with 80% or more disability at par with blind persons. This direction is far-reaching as it has transformed a privilege confined to the class as a legal right to be availed by persons with serve disabilities.

National Federation of the Blind v. BMTC & Ors.[^132] In this Public Interest litigation decided in 2018, the Karnataka High Court directed the Bangalore Municipal Transport Corporation to reconsider its decision of withdrawal of free bus passes to visually impaired persons. Upon the same, the Bangalore Municipal Transport Corporation restored the facility to visually impaired persons.

Besides, many blind people usually travel alone from one city to another in connection with their business. In one such case a blind person, carrying on the business of selling toys happened to travel to Mumbai. While he travelled, he fell from the train receiving serious injuries resulting in the amputation of both his legs. He filed a claim before the Railway Claims Tribunal for recovering compensation. He contended that he was travelling with a valid ticket which he lost during the accident. Accepting his contention and the evidence, the Railway Claims Tribunal under Railway Accidents and Untoward Incidents (Compensation) Rules, 1990 granted him a compensation of INR 4,00,000/-. The same was opposed in an appeal before the Bombay High Court by Indian Railways. their principal contention was that it was the case of self-inflicted injury. As the blind person was negligently travelling alone by train without accompanied by an escort. Rejecting the arguments of the railways, the High Court held that “There is no provision under which the Railways provide a companion to a blind passenger. The scheme is of granting some concession to the companion travelling with a blind person in the ticket fare. The respondent who was carrying on a small business of selling the toys at Satara was not expected to carry a companion with him.”[^133] The court also awarded INR 7000/- as the cost of litigation.

The case of India Centre for Human Rights & Law & Ors. v The Union of India & Ors.[^134], is a court-monitored Public Interest Litigation, wherein various directions were sought to implement accessibility-related provisions under the PWD Act, 1995 and other related guidelines. Directions were sought from the Bombay High Court inter alia to raise the heights of the platform and to make every local station in the city of Bombay accessible. For the same, the court ordered an access audit of railway stations in Mumbai. The audit was conducted by the Indian Center for Human Rights and Law along with the Collective for Spatial Alternatives (CSA), an urban research and planning group.[^135] The report runs into two volumes and had made suggestions to improve the accessibility of stations based on the guidelines prepared and published by the Ministry of Urban Development in 2016, called the Harmonized Guidelines and Space Standards on Barrier Free Built Environment for Persons With Disabilities and Elderly Persons, 2015 (HG2015) and the Railway Board guidelines for passenger amenities for persons with disabilities, 2013 (RBG2013). Presently the Indian railway is engaged in the preparation of guidelines to make the railways accessible in accordance with provisions of the RPWD Act, 2016\. Presently the discussion is in consultation mode.[^136]

### **A4.3 Planning**

Under the Constitution of India so far as Central and provinces are concerned, there is no explicit entry dealing with town and country planning. However, entry 20 of List III, i.e., concurrent list of Seventh Schedule deals with social and economic planning.

So far as the province of Maharashtra is concerned, the subject matter of regional and town planning is regulated by the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966\. So far as municipalities and panchayats are concerned, which are the parts of local and self-government the Constitution of India, through the 11th and 12th schedule have devolved the subject matter of road, land improvements, Maintenance of community assets to the latter, whereas the subject matters of Urban planning including town planning, Regulation of land-use and construction of buildings and planning for economic and social development fall within the domain of the former. Moreover, Article 243 ZD envisages a district planning committee. It reads

_“ (1) There shall be constituted in every State at the district level a District Planning Committee to consolidate the plans prepared by the Panchayats and the Municipalities in the district and to prepare a draft development plan for the district as a whole. (2) The Legislature of a State may, by law, make provision with respect to— (a) the composition of the District Planning Committees; (b) the manner in which the seats in such Committees shall be filled: Provided that not less than four-fifths of the total number of members of such Committee shall be elected by, and from amongst, the elected members of the Panchayat at the district level and of the Municipalities in the district in proportion to the ratio between the population of the rural areas and of the urban areas in the district; (c) the functions relating to district planning which may be assigned to such Committees; (d) the manner in which the Chairpersons of such Committees shall be chosen. (3) Every District Planning Committee shall, in preparing the draft development plan,— (a) have regard to— (i) matters of common interest between the Panchayats and the Municipalities including spatial planning, sharing of water and other physical and natural resources, the integrated development of infrastructure and environmental conservation; (ii) the extent and type of available resources whether financial or otherwise; (b) consult such institutions and organisations as the Governor may, by order, specify. (4) The Chairperson of every District Planning Committee shall forward the development plan, as recommended by such Committee, to the Government of the State_”. The provision is also made for the constitution of a metropolitan planning committee.

Article 243 ZE reads _“(1)There shall be constituted in every Metropolitan area a Metropolitan Planning Committee to prepare a draft development plan for the Metropolitan area as a whole. (2) The Legislature of a State may, by law, make provision with respect to— (a) the composition of the Metropolitan Planning Committees; (b) the manner in which the seats in such Committees shall be filled: Provided that not less than two-thirds of the members of such Committee shall be elected by, and from amongst, the elected members of the Municipalities and Chairpersons of the Panchayats in the Metropolitan area in proportion to the ratio between the population of the Municipalities and of the Panchayats in that area; (c) the representation in such Committees of the Government of India and the Government of the State and of such organisations and institutions as may be deemed necessary for carrying out the functions assigned to such Committees; (d) the functions relating to planning and coordination for the Metropolitan area which may be assigned to such Committees; (e) the manner in which the Chairpersons of such Committees shall be chosen. (3) Every Metropolitan Planning Committee shall, in preparing the draft development plan,— (a) have regard to— (i) the plans prepared by the Municipalities and the Panchayats in the Metropolitan area; (ii) matters of common interest between the Municipalities and the Panchayats, including coordinated spatial planning of the area, sharing of water and other physical and natural resources, the integrated development of infrastructure and environmental conservation; (iii) the overall objectives and priorities set by the Government of India and the Government of the State; (iv) the extent and nature of investments likely to be made in the Metropolitan area by agencies of the Government of India and of the Government of the State and other available resources whether financial or otherwise; (b) consult such institutions and organisations as the Governor may, by order, specify. (4) The Chairperson of every Metropolitan Planning Committee shall forward the development plan, as recommended by such Committee, to the Government of the State_.”

The 73rd and 74th Amendments have brought in a paradigm shift in the nature of governance. Article 243P (e) recognizes a municipality as an institution of self-government and Article 243W proposes that the Legislature of a State may, by law, endow “_the Municipalities with such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as institutions of self-government and such law may contain provisions for the devolution of powers and responsibilities upon Municipalities._”

Following this, the National Urban Planning Framework acknowledges that state governments have the principal constitutional responsibility for urban development and has thus, attempted to offer considerable assistance to states for preparing their own urban state policies. Although we do not have any express and explicit Constitutional provisions mandating the centre to aim at equitable planning based on entry 20 of the concurrent list, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, the Government of India has recently rolled out the **National Urban Policy Framework** – strategic intent.[^137] As it is clear from the title of the document, it is more of a framework containing recommendations. At the most, it may be characterised as an aspirational charter to be adhered to, by the provinces and cities during planning. To briefly allude to the document “_This National Urban Policy Framework (NUPF) outlines an integrated and coherent approach towards the future of urban planning in India. The NUPF is not an attempt to provide a detailed, top-down guidebook for how to build and manage Indian cities. It recognizes that most urban issues are under the jurisdiction of States or Urban Local Bodies and those solutions must be customized to the local context. One of the starting principles of NUPF 2020 is that the imposition of a standardized, tightly codified prescription is not desirable._” The endorsement of a flexible approach though may look to be practicable when it comes to compliance with the accessibility norms, often the same is invoked to deprioritize the issue on the ground of lack of resources or its use. However, normatively the document sounds very progressive. Taking cognizance of the lack of integration of planning and economic planning, it is emphasised that the skewed hierarchy of settlements mainly resulting from colonialism has to be remedied so that the schemes and policies pertaining to the same are effectively realised.

The vision statement of the framework stresses inter alia on g ease of living, responsive governance, sustainable environment for citizens. However, it would have been apt had there been an explicit reference to the inclusive design and barrier-free environment for PWDs. The framework has identified 14 core principles out of which the following are relevant for our purposes: **“_People-centric: Citizens First-Project Next_** _– The proposed approach puts citizens first rather than projects. Its central purpose is to give primacy to the needs of citizens and allow their voices to be heard about what outcomes matter most to them. These outcomes could, for instance, include safer and more predictable water supply (instead of just more pipelines), improved sanitation (instead of just more toilets), easier mobility (instead of just more buses or flyovers), and more learning (instead of just more schools) and so on….”_

**“_Based on End Results: Promotes ‘Function’ Over ‘Form’_** _The program proposes a direct focus on ‘function’ as opposed to a dominant focus on ‘form’. To exemplify, mobility is a function, Unified Metropolitan Transportation Authority is a form_….”

**“_Objective: Promotes Independent Performance Evaluation_**

_Ensuring the independence, integrity, and efficiency of the evaluation process would be critical as this would instil confidence that the process has been impartial and that the outcomes claimed have indeed been achieved. Independent monitoring would also increase the rigor in reporting systems_.”

**“_Data-Driven: Supports Evidence-based Decision Making_** _Since the accurate measurement of outcomes is essential to the process, the approach will promote data-driven governance. At present, even a basic parameter such as the number of households in a city is not verifiable_.”

UNCRPD also emphasizes the importance of disability desegregated data for effective planning and allocation of funds.

**\*“Transparent: Public Disclosure and Citizen Engagement** The basic premise of this approach is citizen satisfaction; all claims of performance would be publicly disclosed for citizen evaluation and feedback at all times during the program’s operation.”\*

_“**Fosters Innovation: Do More with Less** The magnitude, complexity, and diversity of urban challenges makes it immensely important to foster innovation to deliver community-centric, cost-effective and sustainable solutions. So far, however, supply-driven engineering solutions have been the norm, resulting in the inefficient use of scarce resources….”._ This principle is very important vis-à-vis PWDs and older people in terms of fostering inclusive and universal design during the planning and combating ableism and regimentation. For the implementation of strategic intent underlying this framework, the functional areas have been enlisted, and every city is obligated to prepare a City Comprehensive Urban Plan (CCUP) containing the key actions listed in the ten functional areas under the ‘city’ category.

For our purpose following functional areas are relevant;

1\. Urban Planning

3\. Physical Infrastructure

4\. Social Infrastructure

6\. Transportation and Mobility

8\. Urban Governance

**Urban Planning**

Taking cognizance of a lack of implementation of earlier master plans, the focus is directed on inter alia on people-centred development accounting for diverse needs of all residents, particularly the poor, differently-abled, and the disadvantaged.

**Physical Infrastructure**

The framework leaves the enlisting of the final outcomes to be collaboratively developed and be sensitive to meet a broad range of citizen expectations and have the concurrence of all tiers of government. In terms of generalisation, this rationale looks inclusive but accessibility or barrier-free environment being matters often not to be envisaged as a part of mainstream, may be overlooked. Therefore, during the process of enlistment, a conscious effort must be made for the explicit incorporation of the same.

**Social Infrastructure**

One of the rationales of this functional area is to provide employment in close geographical proximity to all, education that focuses on learning outcomes and developing life skills, the convergence of different health schemes and agencies under the urban local bodies, upgrading municipal and government school infrastructure with digitally empowered learning outcomes, with a focus on the poor and the disadvantaged, and caring for the migrants, women, children, widows, elderly and differently-abled. Instead of caring the word empowering would have been suitable. While dealing with social infrastructure, what is envisaged is the conception of a healthy city adopted by WHO according to whom ‘A Healthy City is one that is continually creating and improving those physical and social environments and expanding those community resources which enable people to mutually support each other in performing all the functions of life and in developing to their maximum potential’ (Goldstein and Kickbusch, 1996). Adherence to a support-based model of community sounds very effective and empowering.

**Transportation and Mobility**

For reducing congestion and advancing smart mobility, adherence to the principle of moving people rather than vehicles, by encouraging walking, cycling, and the use of public transport has been emphasised. This principle is also reflected in the National Urban Transport Policy and other alike schemes of the government. Out of the underlying rationales of this functional area, the following deserve special mention – Preparation of guidelines by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs in respect of promoting the street to function both as a channel for mobility and access and as a common public space, expansion of public transport to make it inclusive, affordable, and accessible for all parts of society especially the vulnerable groups and the differently-abled, women, older persons, and to ensure their last mile connectivity in order to create equity amongst citizens.

**Urban governance**

Urban development in India is a state subject under the Constitution of India, explicitly referred to, in its 11th and 12th Schedule and which was introduced by the 73rd and 74th Amendments of the Constitution. Although the rationales underlying this functional area inter alia emphasise to address fragmentation and multiplicity of authorities at the city level, to fix accountability of the elected ward members, to introduce capacity building measures for local elected representatives and city officials, etc. there is hardly any account of a lack of representation in local bodies to the PWDs. In our opinion, Article 243 D (6) and T (6) of the Constitution of India dealing with panchayats and municipalities respectively has remained a dead letter in so far as their non-invocation to provide representation to the PWDs is concerned. The article 243 D (6) reads _“Nothing in this Part shall prevent the Legislature of a State from making any provision for reservation of seats in any Panchayat or offices of Chairpersons in the Panchayats at any level in favour of backward class of citizens_”. To similar effect is clause 6 of Article 243T of the Constitution of India. All these functional areas are backed by the summary of actions at the city, province, and central government levels. To make this framework effective, the annexure to the same provides an outcome matrix and verifiable indicators. To sum up, the document looks very progressive overall and if implemented to its core, has the potential to transform urban planning in India and make a difference in the life of older people and PWDs. At the cost of repetition, it is submitted that even if the urban planning may be the subject matter falling in state domain as the RPWD Act, 2016 has been enacted by Parliament of India to ratify UNCRPD it is obligated to push the envelope and persuade the provincial governments to show requisite sensitivity in the matter.

**Ease of Living Index (2019)**

On the website of the Ministry of Urban and Housing Affairs, the matrix of ease of living index is provided.[^138] It appears that there is a shift in the vision from 2018 to 2019 with emphasis on quality of life. However, both in terms of details and use of language, the matrix does not sound either inclusive or sensitive to the diversity, and particularly to the needs of PWDs. Although it may be argued that the generalised nature of matrix makes them ever-expanding and pregnant with innovations, issues of accessibility and universal design being still away from the mainstream may be overlooked and therefore, it is desirable to recognise the same explicitly.

### **A4.4 Structures for Stakeholder Involvement**

The role of stakeholders for the recognition and enforcement of the Right to accessibility vis-à-vis public streets and transportation and their involvement in planning and designing of streets, policy formulation, and enactment of legislation there are a number of avenues. We may divide the mechanisms into two classes, 1\. Soft law mechanisms and 2\. Hard law mechanisms.

**Soft Law mechanisms**: One of the fundamental principles of Administrative Law is to hold consultations with affected interests. In line with this principle, whenever the Central Government wants to introduce any policy and schemes having any bearing on the right to accessibility of PWDs and older people particularly in respect of streets and transportation, it holds consultations with stakeholders. The involvement of stakeholders may be both during the formulation of policy and schemes, and also by way of seeking suggestions from them before rolling out the policy or schemes. Mostly the stakeholders would be able to mobilize themselves to contribute as DPOs or disability rights experts. Article 8 of the UNCRPD recognizes the necessity of consciousness-raising of state agency and civil society qua disability rights. Stakeholders can make meaningful contributions in the same by holding workshops and programs for engineers, architects, and other allied authorities to raise awareness about making the public street and transportation inclusive. They can also undertake empirical studies to pinpoint accessibility and universal design deficit in the built-in environment and transportation sector. More or less, the same rationale applies to the involvement of older people as stakeholders.

**Public Interest Litigation**: It is another avenue resorted to by Disabled Persons Organisation and public-spirited disability rights activists for mainstreaming the enforcement of the right to accessibility vis a vis street and transportation. It is also possible for courts to appoint, disability rights experts as Amicus Curie to assist the court in the context of such litigation.

**Supreme Court as watchdog:** During the pendency of Public Interest Litigation, often the Supreme Court issues a slew of orders to seek compliance and this compliance is often court monitored. Thus, in the case of Rajive Raturi v. Union of India,[^139] a number of directions were issued in respect of accessible transportation and roads.

**Government Campaign:** The Government of India has launched an accessible India campaign. As a part of this campaign, the Government of India has created an App to involve stakeholders to raise its attention for taking necessary steps to make inter alia transportation accessible.

**Parliamentary activism:** The Parliament of India being the supreme legislature, stakeholders can seek intervention with the help of members of the parliament to ask questions to the concerned ministry in particular, and government in general, about the recognition and enforcement of the right to accessibility inter alia qua public street and transportation. Motion for the discussion on this issue may also be moved by the Member of Parliament. Similarly, whenever a law is proposed, the Government often constitutes a committee of experts/ stakeholders to prepare a draft bill. To make the process of drafting the Bill transparent and inclusive, the committee holds wide consultations with affected interests before finalizing the draft. The draft bill is subsequently finalized by the concerned Ministry to introduce it for the approval of the Cabinet. At times, the Parliament instead of directly taking up the Bill for discussion refers it to the standing committee for detailed discussion and extensive consultation. The standing committee has a mechanism of consultation with affected interests and after gathering inputs from various experts, it sends the bill back to the Parliament where it is finally debated and voted. Thus, we have seen that at every stage right from the preparation of the draft to its final adoption, the stakeholders can intervene, either directly or through representatives to have their inputs. As a matter of fact, this process was followed during the enactment of the RPWD Act, 2016\. The same is in line with paragraph 3 of Article 4 of UNCRPD.[^140]

**Hard Law Mechanisms**

The RPWD Act, 2016 has put in place three mechanisms at the national level for the involvement of Stakeholders for the implementation of its provisions.

Section 60 of the RPWD Act, 2016 envisage s Constitution of a Central Advisory Board on Disability. that consisted of inter alia five members who are experts in the field of disability and rehabilitation, and Members, as far as practicable, being persons with disabilities, to represent non-Governmental Organisations concerned with disabilities or disabled persons organisations. It is also mandated that out of the 10 members, five must be women members, and at least one person each has to represent the Scheduled Caste and the Scheduled Tribe. Besides, the Central Advisory Board also includes a representative of all the ministries, directors of all the national level institutions pertaining to disability, and the national chamber of commerce. The Central Advisory Board being a consultative national body is under an obligation to facilitate the continuous evolution of a comprehensive policy for the empowerment of persons with disabilities and the full enjoyment of rights. Besides, it performs the following other functions,

“(a) advise the Central Government and the State Governments on policies, programmes, legislation and projects with respect to disability;

(b) develop a national policy to address issues concerning persons with disabilities;

(c) review and coordinate the activities of all Departments of the Government and other Governmental and non-Governmental Organisations which are dealing with matters relating to persons with disabilities;

(d) take up the cause of persons with disabilities with the concerned authorities and the international organisations with a view to provide for schemes and projects for the persons with disabilities in the national plans;

(e) recommend steps to ensure accessibility, reasonable accommodation, non-discrimination for persons with disabilities vis-a-vis information, services and the built environment and their participation in social life;

(f) monitor and evaluate the impact of laws, policies and programmes to achieve full participation of persons with disabilities…”

Evidently, it is clear from the analysis of the functions of the Central Advisory Board that it is one of the major platforms for stakeholders to raise their voice and have their say as a part of Government policy. The office of the Chief Commissioner for PWDs is constituted under Section 74 of the RPWD Act, 2016\. The qualification to become Chief Commissioner for PWDs is to have vast experience working in disability and rehabilitation[^141] To conclude, since the Commissioner generally represents the PWDs being herself or himself one of the PWDs, the interaction between the office of the Chief Commissioner of PWDs and stakeholders is much more effective and interactive.

## **A5 State or Provincial-Level Strategy, Law and Policy**

### **A5.1 State or Province 1; State or Province of Maharashtra**

#### **_A5.1.1 Equality and Inclusion_**

##### **_A5.1.1.1 Equality_**

In India, we have a single Constitution, and PWDs and older people are governed by laws enacted by the Parliament. In this light, the State of Maharashtra has to exercise its executive power to comply with the mandate of the Constitution of India flowing from Article 14 and RPWD Act, 2016\. The RPWD Act, 2016 itself mandates the creation of machinery by every State/Province and empowers every State/Province to enact rules for implementation of the provisions of the RPWD Act, 2016\. In the context of equality which is a guaranteed right and an obligation on the State/Province the discussion is confined to the schemes and programs for the attainment of the same even by the State /Province of Maharashtra to implement. The obligation is cast on all the States/provinces including the Province of Maharashtra so that persons with disabilities enjoy the right to equality, life with dignity, and respect for his or her integrity equally with others.[^142] This clause can break down into the following prongs viz. ensuring the right to equality; life with dignity; respect for one’s integrity. The Parliament has created a comparator of ‘others’ to measure the attainment of these rights. ‘Others’ may be interpreted as non-disabled. In other words, State/Province of Maharashtra is expected to harmonize its laws and particularly the planning and designing laws pertaining to streets and public transport to facilitate the navigation and access of the same by PWDs equally with the non-disabled. The Government of Maharashtra is obligated to make alternations in ableist designs of streets and public transport to make it amenable for use equally by both PWDs and non-disabled.

Since in particular cases PWDs and older people may have special needs, the Province of Maharashtra is also under an obligation to have an open dialogue with the people with special needs in particular cases and provide reasonable accommodation to them unless the same does not amount to an imposition of a disproportionate or undue burden in a particular case. While assessing the disproportionate or undue burden, the Province of Maharashtra must be mindful of its ableist structure as default. Moreover, Section 3(3) further obligates the province of Maharashtra not to discriminate against PWDs on the ground of disability. It is made clear that the classification of persons with disabilities as a group for exclusion or discrimination is justified only for a legitimate goal and the means of the classification or discrimination has to be proportionate to such a legitimate goal. In other words, the onus is on the State to justify discrimination of a group of persons on the ground of disability and it has to demonstrate that it has resorted to the same to promote a legitimate goal which is narrowly tailored by the means. Understood thus, it is almost impossible for the province of Maharashtra to promote any legitimate goal by resorting to proportionate means to sustain disability-based discrimination. Besides, one of the important mandates of Section 3 is to obligate the Government of Maharashtra to ensure that all the establishments falling within its control have in place an equal opportunity policy. In our opinion, the level of generality on which Sections 1 and 3(3) are drafted, compels this result if the goals underlying these two clauses were to be provided a concrete threshold. Logically with an equal opportunity policy in place, it would make it possible for the Province of Maharashtra to concretize the right to equality and ensure that it is availed effectively by PWDs. The policy may be worked out in such a manner as to demarcate both reactive and anticipatory duties of the Province and service providers vis-à-vis reasonable accommodation. In reality, however, the picture is very dim as no steps seem to have been taken to give a push for the creation and observance of equal opportunity policy in the province of Maharashtra.

##### **_A5.1.1.2 Accessibility_**

Relevant provisions of the RPWD Act, 2016 imposing obligations on all levels of Government to promote and foster accessibility are equally binding on the Province of Maharashtra. Moreover, the number of policy documents have been evolved by the Government of India, as a framework to be adopted by the State of Maharashtra. We have already discussed the same in A4.1.2

##### **_A5.1.1.3 Disability_**

Since disability is one of the subjects in the realm of provinces[^143] and principally the Provinces have the competence to make legislations governing disability, many provinces in India have their own disability policies. This is so because no province has enacted any law, to regulate disability and the same is governed by the Central Acts, to deal with local aspects, to complement and supplement, these central legislations tend to exercise their executive power to issue disability policies. The Government of the State of Maharashtra had proposed draft of a policy in 2017 in light of the RPWD Act, 2016 and the UNCRPD. The draft was open for objections and comments by stakeholders; however, it appears that since then there is no further progress in the matter. This draft policy seeks to amplify the right to accessibility and a barrier-free environment.[^144]

**Public works department**

The Department of public work is obligated to provide in public buildings facilities of ramps, accessible toilets, and allied facilities as per the provisions of RPWD Act, 2016 to the PWDs. Besides, the Government of Maharashtra has also appointed a State Commissioner for the empowerment of Persons with Disability. The State Commissioner is situated in Pune and was formally established in 2000.[^145] Apart from acting as a civil court to redress grievances submitted to it, the commissioner is also a catalyst in the harmonization of the policy of State Government vis-à-vis the RPWD Act, 2016\. There is also the department of Social Justice & Special Assistance, and the State Commissioner is expected to work in tandem with the same to avail facilities and to evolve schemes and programs for the empowerment of PWDs. The Government of Maharashtra has recently in December 2019 constituted a special Court for PWDs under Section 84 of RPWD Act, 2016 to try offence under chapter XVI of the RPWD Act, 2016 viz. Section 91 Fraudulently availing any benefit meant for persons with benchmark disabilities, Section 92 offences of atrocities etc. This court is also incidentally situated in Pune. This Fast-Track Court will hear cases related to senior citizens and disabled people.[^146] The section 84 of the RPWD Act, states “For the purpose of providing speedy trial, the State Government shall, with the concurrence of the Chief Justice of the High Court, by notification, specify for each district, a Court of Session to be a Special Court to try the offences under this Act.”

A careful look at list II of the Constitution of India demonstrates that disability is a state/provincial subject and therefore primary responsibility must be on each province to take appropriate steps to make the pedestrian environment and public streets barrier-free. However, since the Parliament has enacted the RPWD Act 2016 on an order to ratify the UNCRPD under Article 253 of the Constitution of India, it has occupied the legislative field of disability. Under Article 253 when a legislation is enacted by the Parliament to implement any international treaty, its voice and mandate prevail across all the provinces of India and it has the exclusive authority to take appropriate steps for the implementation of the legislation. In other words, the federal principle of division of powers between the Centre and provinces has no implication and does not create any hurdle in the implementation of such a legislation. In fact, RPWD Act merely talks about its enforcement by the Government of India.[^147] It does not talk about its enforcement by the provinces. In other words, once the RPWD Act, 2016 has been brought into force by the Central Government by issuing a notification in the official gazette it has come into effect throughout India. In this connection, Article 4 paragraph 5 of UNCRPD is also relevant. It reads “The provisions of the present Convention shall extend to all parts of federal States without any limitations or exceptions”.[^148] Similarly, Article 27 of the Vienna Convention of Law Treatise is also significant. It provides “Article 27 Internal law and observance of treaties A party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty……”[^149] thus in the light of Section 1(2) of the RPWD Act, 2016[^150] read with Article 4 (5) of UNCRPD and Article 27 Vienna Convention of Law Treatise, the inescapable conclusion is that the responsibility of the government of India is categorical to implement the provision of the RPWD Act in general and the relevant provision pertaining to accessibility and barrier-free built-in environment for PWDs in particular. This obligation is further strengthened by Article 51(c) of the Constitution of India[^151], one of the Directive Principles of State Policy, imposing obligation similarly on the government to foster respect for international law. It is, therefore, within the sole and exclusive domain of the Government of India to issue relevant directions to all the provinces to take appropriate steps to implement the provisions of the RPWD Act, 2016\.

In this connection, a reference may be made to Article 365 of the Constitution of India. It provides “Where any State has failed to comply with, or to give effect to, any directions given in the exercise of the executive power of the Union under any of the provisions of this Constitution, it shall be lawful for the President to hold that a situation has arisen in which the Government of the State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution” [^152] Article 256 of the Constitution of India makes it incumbent for the provincial government to exercise executive power[^153] in line with and not contrary to the legislation enacted by the Parliament. In other words, provincial governments are enjoined against exercising their executive power contrary to the mandate of the RPWD Act, 2016\. As a matter of fact, provincial governments are under a duty to fine-tuned the exercise of their executive power in the domain of accessibility and barrier-free environment for PWDs in conformity with the relevant provisions of the RPWD Act, 2016\.

Article 257 (1) further obligates the provincial government not to impede or prejudice in the exercise of the executive power by the centre. The Central Government is empowered to give necessary directions to the provincial governments to prevent any impediment or prejudice, in the way of exercise of its executive power. From these provisions, it becomes clear that both in the domain of legislative and executive power Parliament and the Central Government, have been given paramountcy in case of exercise of the legislative or executive power by the provincial legislature and provincial government, is in conflict with the former. Since the implementation of a treaty is the sole and exclusive domain of the Central Government and Parliament, and as Parliament has occupied the field by enacting the RPWD Act, 2016 it is incumbent on all the State Governments in light of Articles 256 and 257 to conform with the decision of the Parliament. In cases, however, where the Central Government or Parliament themselves fail to act in providing necessary directions to the provincial governments, it is more a case of inaction on part of Parliament and central Government than lack of implementation by the Provincial Governments. However, as the judiciary is uniquely placed to ensure that all the citizens of India including Citizens with Disabilities have the right to possess and exercise fundamental rights equally, it can, by issuing suitable remedial directions provide redressal to citizens with disabilities against the inaction on part of the Central Government.

##### **_A5.1.1.4 Older People_**

The Government of Maharashtra has evolved an all-inclusive policy for senior citizens in the country by the Government Resolution 30/09/2013 which was formally enforced by its government resolution dated 9-July-2018[^154] This policy recognizes the impact of scientific development on longevity and tries to engage with ageing population. However, both the policy of the Centre and this policy, by and large, adopt a protectionist approach to older people and have very little in terms of the civil rights of older people. Thus, both the policies focus on concessions and financial benefits. Just like the policy of the Centre, even the Maharashtra state policy refers very briefly to the issue of accessibility and a barrier-free environment.

Under these guidelines, the department of Town planning is required to provide benches in the public parks for older people and PWDs. Similarly, the department is obligated to provide wheelchair-accessible pathways in the public parks.

Guidelines also provide for accessible buses to ensure commutation with ease for older people and PWDs. There is also a mention of a provision for accessible toilets with anti-skid tiles for PWDs and older people. A provision is also made to create a barrier-free and wheelchair-accessible built environment at public places like restaurants, cinema theatres, malls, and public offices, etc. For shopping complexes, commercial premises, and housing complex under construction there are necessary guidelines to create a barrier-free environment for older people, to be provided by the Department of Housing. During the allotment of houses/ shops under government schemes to older people, ground floor to be preferred.

#### **_A5.1.2 Transport_**

We have already discussed the relevant provisions pertaining to accessibility in public transport under the RPWD Act, 2016, in part A 4.2 above and the obligation arising out of the same is also binding on the province of Maharashtra. Besides, along the lines of the National Urban Transport Policy which we have already analyzed in part A 4.2 above, has a spillover effect in Maharashtra too. The Maharashtra government rolled out the Maharashtra State Urban Transport policy (draft version) in 2017\. Inter alia, the policy has implementation metrics. One of the relevant metrics for our purpose is for the transport facilities to be fully accessible to persons with disabilities. This goal is to be met within 10 years after the date of application of this policy, whereas the minimum goal to the accessible footpaths and road crossings to meet within 5 years after the date of application of this policy. Besides, Clause 6.6 of this policy also sheds light on Universal Accessibility. It reads “6.6.1. Cities are required to design all elements of the transport system to be accessible to all users, in compliance with the draft National Building Code/BIS Indian Accessibility Standards (2009).” However, the draft policy is yet to be formally adopted by the State/ Province of Maharashtra.

#### **_A5.1.3 Planning_**

So far (as the provincial level planning is concerned the subject matter is governed in Maharashtra by the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966\. The long title and the preamble to the Act explicitly mentions the main objectives underlying this Act i.e. to undertake development and use of land in Regions, to make better provisions for the preparation of development plans, and to ensure that the town planning schemes are made and executed in an effective manner.[^155] The Act envisages the Regional Planning Board, Regional Planning Committee, Development Authority, Planning Authority, Area Development Authority as the main constituents of the machinery of this Act. A close look at definitions of ‘development’ and ‘amenities’ creates the impression that this Act being much earlier in the timeline to the enactment of the RPWD Act, 2016 or ratification of UNCRPD, there is hardly any emphasis on the importance of principles of inclusion and universal design vis-à-vis development or planning. However, the province is under an obligation to make necessary changes in its building byelaws, and street and pedestrian policies as a consequence of ratification of UNCRPD by the government. We have already seen that the policies relating to streets in Pune, definitely reflect the UNCRPD and the position in Delhi is not any different. However, the real challenge lies in the actual implementation of these policies. To implement the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966, the Government of Maharashtra has enacted the Unified Development control and promotion Regulations for Maharashtra 2020[^156]. These regulations shall apply to the building activities and development works on lands within the jurisdiction of all the Planning Authorities and Regional Plan areas excluding certain areas. These Regulations shall also be applicable to the Town Planning Scheme area. Unfortunately, the regulation is not sensitive to the universal design and the needs of PWDs and older people. While dealing with the ‘development of street’ paragraph 3.3.6 provides “Development of Street Means of access / internal road shall be levelled, metalled, flagged, paved, sewered, drained, channelled, lighted, laid with water supply line and provided with trees for shade (wherever necessary), free of encroachment and shall be maintained in proper condition.”

While enlisting the Smart features of the Township, although reference is made to “Continuous unobstructed footpath of minimum 2 m. width on either side of all street/roads of width ROW 12 m. or more and of a lesser width for roads / Streets of ROW less than 12 m,” there is hardly any awareness with regard to tac-tiling of the same or making it accessible to the wheelchair users, and older people, visually challenged, etc. The same is also applicable to the pedestrian pathways.[^157] Although there are provisions dealing with providing the specification of ramps, in absence of accessibility and universal design-sensitive language, the mention of the same is of very little significance.[^158] While dealing with the regional planning, the Standardised Development Control and Promotion Regulations for Regional Plan Area for the State of Maharashtra enlists the building requirements taking into account the needs of physically handicapped as “5. Building requirements: The specified facilities for the buildings for physically handicapped persons shall be as follows:

1\. Approach to plinth level,

2\. Corridor connecting the entrance/exit for the handicapped,

3\. Stair-ways,

4\. Lift,

5\. Toilet, and

6\. Drinking Water”[^159].

The use of the term ‘physically handicapped’ is unfortunate.

#### **_A5.1.4 Structures for Stakeholder Involvement_**

As we have discussed in the earlier section, though the subject matter of disability is a state/provincial subject in List II, Entry 9 of the 7th Schedule read with Article 246 of the Constitution of India, no state/province has yet made any law by exercising its legislative power on this subject matter. On the other hand, the Parliament in order to ratify the commitment made by the executive to fulfil the international commitments, has made legislations under Article 253 of the Constitution of India to incorporate the Asia Pacific Declaration of 1993 to 2002 and UNCRPD by enacting the PWD Act, 1995, and by repealing the 1995 Act by enacting the RPWD Act, 2016\. We have already discussed the national-level mechanism under the RPWD Act, 2016 to facilitate the involvement of stakeholders. In this section, we discuss the state/provincial level mechanism for the same provided under this law.

Since soft law mechanisms are general in nature, suffice to say that their utility in the context of provinces is the same and therefore the discussion of the same in the national level section is mutatis mutandis applicable to the provinces. Hence, the same need not be repeated. The State/ Provincial governments are obligated under Section 66 of the RPWD Act, 2016 to constitute a State Advisory Board. The State Advisory Board is deemed to be the State-level consultative and advisory body on disability matters. It is under an obligation to facilitate the continuous evolution of a comprehensive policy for the empowerment of PWDs and the full enjoyment of rights. Except for the fact that the State Advisory Board is to operate at State/Provincial level, its functions are analogous to that of the Central Advisory Board and therefore, need not be repeated. Suffice it to say that there is nothing on record to demonstrate the active role played by both these Boards in revisiting the National or State/provincial policies for the empowerment of PWDs. This is surprising as in June 2020, in 26 provinces, the Advisory Board was constituted.[^160] A look at its composition on the provincial level demonstrates that the legislature is keen to provide a geographical representation to the different parts of the state and therefore, provides for the nomination of five members by rotation from different districts, based on the recommendation of the district administration. Besides, the Board is also represented by five members who are experts in the field of disability and rehabilitation. Also, ten persons as far as practicable, being persons with disabilities, are to represent non-Governmental Organisations or associations which are concerned with disabilities: Provided that out of the ten persons nominated under this clause, at least, five shall be women and at least one person each shall be from the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. Thus, there is a fair amount of room for the involvement of stakeholders in the decision-making of the Board. Like the Chief Commissioner at Central Level, at the provincial level under Section 79 of the RPWD Act, 2016, the State Commissioner is to be appointed. The functions of the State Commissioner are the same as that of the Chief Commissioner, except her jurisdiction is confined to a particular province.

Again, to make her decisions experiential and representative, the state government is under an obligation to constitute an Advisory Committee comprising of not more than five members drawn from the experts in the disability sector. The reporting mechanism which has been discussed in the respect of the Chief Commissioner is, ipso facto, applicable to the State Commissioners, with a modification that the Commissioner has to submit the report to the State government. By June 2020 in only nine provinces such an Advisory committee was constituted. Earlier, in 2018, a comprehensive study was undertaken by the Disability Rights India Foundation (DRIF) in collaboration with the National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People (NCPEDP) and National Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (NCRPD), demonstrating abysmal state of implementation of the RPWD Act, 2016 by various provinces. To take only a few findings “4. 37.5% of the States have not appointed Commissioners for Persons with Disabilities. Even in the 62.5% of the States where there are Commissioners, the progress has not been substantial. The reason could be that many States do not have full-time commissioners. Only 3 states (12.5%) have constituted Advisory Committees, comprising of experts, to assist the State Commissioner.”[^161] The number of State Advisory Committee to Assist Disability Commissioner has reached nine in June 2020\. Further, the report mentions “79.2% of the States have not constituted the State Fund for implementing the Act.”[^162]

As regards the rules under the RPWD Act, 2016 are concerned, the report shows “Majority of the States (58.3%) have not notified the State Rules, in spite of the Act mandating that it should be notified within six months of the enforcement of the Act.”[^163]

The Urban Development Department of the Government of Maharashtra organized workshops in five cities/metropolitan regions to create awareness/collect feedback about the draft Maharashtra State Urban Transport Policy. ITDP was nominated as the knowledge partner for these workshops.

The cities / metropolitan regions are:[^164]

- Pune

- Nashik

- Nagpur

- Aurangabad

- Mumbai Metropolitan Region

### **A5.2 State or Province; National Capital Territory**

Delhi is not strictly a state/ province. It has the status of National Capital Territory. To put it briefly, the National capital territory is neither fully a State/province nor a city. Its status is in between although it has an elected government headed by the Chief Minister and Council of Ministers. There is a fair amount of dominance of the Lt. Governor who is an appointee of the President of India. Delhi being the capital of India as well, there is a complicated network of relations between the Central government and its elected government. Therefore, the following parameters concerning Delhi are discussed in A 6.2.

## **A6 City-Level Strategy, Law and Policy**

### **A6.1 City 1; Pune**

#### **_A6.1.1 Equality and Inclusion_**

##### **_A6.1.1.1 Equality_**

We are not aware of any formal policy initiative adopted by the Municipal Corporation of Pune. However, suffice it to say that as a part of the State of Maharashtra, the city of Pune is under an obligation to implement the equality mandate under the RPWD Act, 2016 by orienting itself with Section 3 of the RPWD Act, 2016 which is discussed above in A 5.1.1 (a).

##### **_A6.1.1.2 Accessibility_**

Pune Municipal Corporation has prepared a policy document ‘Urban Street Design Guidelines Pune’[^165] for offering guidance to the planners and designers. The key principle of this document is the ‘equitable allocation of street space’. The document also draws on the National Urban Transport policy. The urban street-design guidelines as a policy document prioritize places and people over the movement of a vehicle. The main purpose underlying these guidelines is to provide a mechanism for establishing the street system to accommodate growth and cater to the transportation choices and keep the city liveable. The guidelines aim at outlining a process of street designing in such a manner to ensure that optimum priority is given to both motorized and non-motorized users.

The Pune Municipal Corporation has conceived this document as a common reference point for all stakeholders of urban street designing, and to address the issues related to traffic and transportation, these guidelines are made applicable by the Pune Municipal Corporation within its jurisdiction that is to say entire Pune City. Its coverage includes all existing roads and proposed roads. The policy is binding on all professionals involves in the planning, designing, construction, approval, and maintenance of streets within the jurisdiction of Pune Municipal Corporation. The Pune Municipal Corporation has explicitly urged the NGOs and activists working in the domain of traffic and transportation, to take cognizance of this document and work alongside its officials for the effective adherence of Urban Street Development Guidelines, Pune. The Urban Street Development Guidelines, Pune is a very comprehensive document drawing on several policy initiatives, studies, and existing legislations viz. the Indian Road Congress Guidelines, Guidelines and Toolkits for Urban Transportation Development prepared for by Ministry of Urban Development, the National Urban Transport policy (Apr 2006), Recommendation of the Working Group on the 12th Five Year Plan, Study on traffic and transportation policies and strategies in Urban Areas in India, Ministry of Urban Development, India 2008, National Mission on sustainable habitats: Report of the subcommittee on Urban Transport, Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (plg. and Engg.) Centre, Urban Local Bodies initiative e.g., pedestrian policy, comprehensive mobility plan, etc., better streets, better cities ITDP, the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, the PWD Act, 1995, the UNCRPD. The Urban Street Development Guidelines, Pune has identified mainly five types of streets.[^166] The feeder street – i.e., an intermediary between main roads and neighbourhood streets, neighbourhood streets \- narrow access streets connecting feeder streets and individual properties, and through-traffic streets. All these three types of streets i.e., streets connecting outer suburban areas of the city and mobility corridor are relevant for our project. Besides, the roads in Pune are identified as Mobility corridors and Mobility Corridors with Non-Motor Travellers.

The Urban Street Development Guidelines, Pune broadly identifies three areas of concern relating to streets \- street elements, street safety, and multi-utility zone. The discussion on street elements covers design recommendations based on standards and norms for all such street elements related to mobility aspects. The lynchpin underlying the street elements is that all people should be able to move safely, smoothly, and conveniently. Amongst a variety of components of street elements for our purpose is ‘footpath’ relevant. The guidelines deal with ‘attributes of good footpath design’ which includes accessibility by all users, connectivity, and continuity, adjoined landscaping to create a buffer space between pedestrians and vehicles, and also provide shade and adjoining social space (an area where pedestrians can safely participate in public life). To read between the lines of these attributes, footpath should be free from encroachments, parking, utility obstructions, walkable, clean, and safe for pedestrians. The guidelines provide for design recommendations of the footpath in respect of the layout, surface, and level.

To summarize the design recommendations in respect of the layout, it can be pointed out that pedestrian traffic, universal accessibility design, and street hierarchy are some of the important elements determining the width of the footpath. To put it specifically, the footpath needs to be clear and unobstructed with a minimum walking zone of 2m horizontally with 2.4m vertical clearance. The attainment of the minimum non-obstructibility mentioned above is dependent on the ideal design of the Multi-Utility zone. In other words, elements like trees, streetlights, street furniture, etc. have to be located within multi-utility zones. The guidelines recommend increasing the width of the footpath to ensure a minimum clear walking zone, in case the removal of the obstruction is not possible. It has to be borne in mind that the guidelines rightly point out that the full width of the footpath practically is never available to the pedestrians because of shops, buildings, compound walls, etc. on the sidelines of the footpath. This problem is compounded in a city like Pune in the presence of the infinite number of hawkers. The same has to be kept in mind by the planners while suggesting and recommending accessible footpaths. In short, the designers must have a clear awareness about the dead zones resulting from obstructions like shops and buildings.

So far as the surface of the footpath is concerned, the design recommendation states that it should be tough and anti-skid. Along with maintaining consistency in respect of the design, colour, texture, and level be maintained to provide clear visibility and visual continuity. In respect of the level of the footpath, the design recommendation is that the uniform height of a maximum of 150mm above the road level is to be maintained. In case where maintaining such height is not possible, then the railing or curbstone type separators should be provided to the walkway segregated from the carriageway. The level of the footpath has to be the same as that of the entrance of the property and junctions where the side street meets the main street. The guidelines emphasize that at no cost, the height of the footpath should be compromised. Additionally, it provides for gradual slopes towards the street storm water drain to avoid water accumulation and suitable ramps at entry and exit of footpaths; however, ramps should not eat out the width of the footpath. It is to be kept in mind that the steps at the property entrance, vehicular access ramp should not hamper clear walkway for the pedestrians and particularly for PWDs.

Urban Street design guidelines, Pune also deals with the facilitation of access to public transport. A bus stop is one of the most important facilitating points. Since city buses are cheaper as affordable means of transport, along with the general public, it is also used by PWDs, women, older people. Etc. The guidelines contain a number of suggestions about the construction and the design of the bus stop but barely touch on the issue of accessibility to make the same, accommodative, and inclusive for PWDs and older people.

The guidelines have a dedicated chapter on safety elements. One of the major aspects of safety as to the street pedestrian vis a vis PWDs is a road crossing. To make the pedestrian crossing facilitative for PWDs, a provision is made for tactile paving embedded in the zebra crossing. In respect of the refuge island, where the pedestrians can wait while crossing the street, the guidelines provide that the width of the island should be not less than 3 meters to make it accessible to the wheelchair users. Foot over-bridge and pedestrian subways are other avenues of street crossing for pedestrians. To enable access to the subways by PWDs, the guidelines suggest for humped streets to reduce the number of steps to the subway. To provide access to the foot over bridges, the guidelines mention the utility of the lift without making it mandatory. The guidelines also have provisions to calm the traffic; the same is essential to ensure the safety of pedestrians. To prevent traffic on the footpath and to ensure that the pedestrians cross the streets through the designated areas of the footpath, railings must be installed in the vicinity of a junction. The guidelines also emphasize bollards and streetlights for ensuring the safety of pedestrians.

Another element of the safety of the pedestrians is to ensure the observance of traffic signs and visit non-observance of the same with penalty and punishments to the drivers. The relevant legislation dealing with this is the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988\. For enforcement actions see D4.1. The guidelines also attach importance to the installation of pedestrian signals but are silent on the use of accessible technology for the same. The guidelines, apart from taking cognizance of the principles of the Universal design enlist the following as the essential requirements of accessible footpaths/sidewalks for PWDs – the level of the sidewalk should be firm, slip-resistant, and stable, It should be continuous in the sense that it should be free from projections drops or unexpected variations in level, To facilitate navigation people with visual impairments the footpath should be fitted with guiding blocks like tactile blocks or Braille inscribed blocks, Taking into account other disabilities there are design recommendations like visual signs and well-defined edges of paths and routes by use of different colours and textures.

The importance of curb cuts is also highlighted to facilitate the safe navigation of PWDs at the entry and exit points of pathways. The guidelines also provide for stipulations in respect of the erection of bollards and grating. It is necessary to shed some light on tactile paving. The guidelines identify the following key points: 1\. Textured bright coloured tiles are recommended for the construction of tactile paving to provide guidance to visually impaired pedestrians. 2\. The location of the tactile paving must be such as to avoid obstructions like manholes, tree guards, etc. 3\. The colours of the tiles must be in contrast with the surface of the surroundings. Tactile paving may be extremely useful to facilitate the navigation of persons with visual impairments if it is installed in front of the area where traffic is present, at the entrance and exit of a staircase, multilevel crossings, transport terminals, and boarding areas. Similarly, tactile paving is very helpful for visually impaired persons to have access to approach the road, guiding the path to the public facility transport station. The guidelines also contain details of specifications about the placement of these pavements in terms of measurements and their vicinity to ramps, stairs, entrance, warning blocks, and crossings. The guidelines also contain details about curb and slope ramps, universal design for intersection, crossing, pedestrian grade separator, traffic signal, street furniture and signage, and public toilets.

Dealing with the process of street designs, the guidelines emphasize consultation with the stakeholders, like the Pune Municipal Corporation road engineers, traffic police, PMPML, local elected representative, tress authority, MSEDCL (electric supply co.), local NGOs, and environmentalists, experts, etc. The absence of explicit reference to PWDs and older people is conspicuous.

**Policy for Pedestrian Facilities and Safety in Pune City, January 2016[^167]**

Acknowledging that due to vehicular centric measures, the conditions for pedestrians having been drastically worsened, and Senior citizens, the infirm, those with special needs, ladies and children being most badly hit, this policy has been adopted by the Pune Municipal Corporation. The obvious option to get rid of the plight of the pedestrians is to strike a delicate balance between the vehicular centric measures and the facilities for pedestrians. The ‘National Urban Transport Policy’ (NUTP) and the ‘Comprehensive Mobility Plan, Pune’ (CMP) have rightly given top priority to public transport, walking, and cycling. The PMC is mandated to adhere to the aforementioned policy instruments during the formulation of traffic and transport-related plans. The policy attaches utmost importance to walking in terms of the fundamental right guaranteed in the Constitution of India (Article 19 (1) (d)).

Moreover, the betterment of the pedestrian facilities is an impetus for encouraging more and more people to walk and use public transport. 1\) Lack of safe, usable footpaths 2\) Lack of safe pedestrian road crossings 3\) Lack of adequate pedestrian phase in traffic signal cycle 4\) Lack of adequate enforcement to ensure safe passage for pedestrians 5\) Lack of proper maintenance of footpaths and pedestrian road crossings 6\) Increased volume of traffic 7\) Increased speed of vehicles 8\) Wider roads 9\) Larger junctions 10\) One-way roads 11\) Signal free roads and junctions 12\) Traffic indiscipline, are the rationale for the adoption of the pedestrian policy. Apart from noting that road crossing in Pune has become life-threatening, the policy highlights many problems faced by the pedestrians such as the lack of proper pedestrian refuge area, inaccessible zebra crossing due to parked vehicles, faded zebra crossing, lack of same level connectivity to the footpath in case of raised crossing, high-speed movement of vehicle posing life threats at mid-block crossing, potholes, dislocated chamber covers, and uneven road surfaces resulting in stumbling of senior citizens and PWDs, the inadequacy of street light.

Additionally, the policy also highlights several signal-related issues, especially the absence of signal system sensitive to the visually impaired is highlighted. The policy also raises concerns in respect of the grade-separated crossing, e.g., senior citizens and PWDs find it extremely difficult and inaccessible to climb the large number of steps to access the grade-separated crossings. Even though there is a provision for lifts, they are not properly maintained and at times without operators, compounding the accessibility issue of senior citizens and children. The misuse of the foot over bridges and subways by anti-social elements, seepage, and the accumulation of water resulting in slippery floors further aggravates the difficulties of the pedestrians and prolongs the time for crossing roads. Noting that in the absence of proper pedestrian policy, change in the behavioral pattern of both the pedestrians and the vehicle drivers is not possible, this policy is adopted by PMC. Lack of pedestrian facilities and uniform procedure in deciding what type of pedestrian road crossing to be provided are additional factors for rolling out this policy.

The policy envisions Pune to be a pedestrian-friendly city with dignity for pedestrians and care for their safety and wellbeing. In order to make Pune a liveable city, the policy aims at providing high-quality infrastructure with equitable allocation of road spaces and make walking a pleasant experience. In light of the above vision statement, the policy has set up the following goals: “1) Safety and comfort for all pedestrians irrespective of age, sex, status and special needs 2\) Improved access and mobility for all citizens at all times as per need by providing necessary safe and usable pedestrian facilities which will be well designed and well maintained 3\) Better road design and traffic calming to make roads safer for pedestrians and other road users also 4\) Status, dignity and top priority to walking by changing the existing attitude and mindset of all concerned 5\) Promotion of walking as a convenient and zero cost mode of transport 6\) Creation of ‘pedestrian-only zones’ in the city.”[^168] In the context of planning efficient pedestrian navigation, this policy document is crucial. It adopts a number of vital guidelines. “1) All roads shall have a designated path for walking conveniently and safely. 2\) The entire pedestrian infrastructure on-road (footpaths, road crossings, etc.) shall be well designed, adequate in size, and universally accessible (barrier-free) so that all persons including those with special needs, senior citizens, and children would be able to walk /move on the road and cross the road safely and conveniently. 3\) All roads shall have designated crossings for pedestrians where any person would be able to cross the road without any difficulty or exposure to any risk at any time of the day, as long as the proper rules for crossing are followed.”[^169]

One of the important elements of the normative structure evolved for the enforcement of this policy is “In case of any conflict between provisions in various standards, priority shall be given for pedestrian safety and convenience in the design of streets and space allocation.”[^170] The Involvement of urban designers/ experts in designing pedestrian facilities is advocated.[^171] Inter alia it is provided that “Adequate budgetary provision as required shall be made on an annual basis for new pedestrian facilities and operation, maintenance, security of existing grade- separated crossings (FOBs, subways) and other facilities.”[^172] An effective system and a mechanism (cell/department) with necessary financial provisions and dedicated manpower shall be set up as a nodal unit for addressing matters regarding the availability of safe, convenient, obstacle-free, and usable facilities/infrastructure on road for pedestrians (footpaths, road crossings, etc.). The cell/department should review plans/drawings for the pedestrian infrastructure projects and traffic plans to ensure that appropriate provisions for pedestrian safety and convenience have been incorporated. A senior PMC officer from Roads Department shall be assigned the responsibility of a nodal officer for coordinating related activities with all concerned departments/persons. The policy highlights the adoption of a pedestrian-friendly planning paradigm focusing on accessibility over mobility.

Although the policy goes a long way in highlighting the concerns of pedestrians, does it match with existing ground realities of Pune city is a real question. Moreover, apart from discreetly talking about PWDs and senior citizens, the policy fails to expressly emphasize issues like auditory signals, tactile strips, ramps, etc. Moreover, it does not make any reference whatsoever to the PWD Act, 1995 or the RPWD Act, 2016\. There is also no account of relevant provisions and principles underlying the UNCRPD. These omissions are glaring and surprising, in the wake of the reputation of the city of Pune being progressive and also leads to speculation whether the drafting process of this policy represented PWDs and elderly persons. The policy also lacks in not providing remedies for violation of rights of PWDs and elder persons as pedestrians.

##### **_A6.1.1.3 Disability_**

Going to the third sphere of the federation, institutions of local self-governments are also obligated to perform their part of the responsibilities for the empowerment of PWDs.[^173] Constitutionally, the same is mandated though generically through Article 243 ZD[^174] which reads in its relevant part _“(1) There shall be constituted in every State at the district level a District Planning Committee to consolidate the plans prepared by the Panchayats and the Municipalities in the district and to prepare a draft development plan for the district as a whole.”_ Under Article 243-D (6) and 243-T (6)[^175] of the Constitution of India, the Provinces are empowered to provide representations to the backward class of citizens in Panchayats and Municipalities by way of quotas. The same may come into play in respect of the disabled, being part of the backward class of citizens.

Since Pune is one of the cities of survey under this project, it would be appropriate to look at initiatives of the Pune Municipal Corporation and the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation. The initiative of Pune Municipal Corporation is mainly through Welfare schemes viz. Free bus pass scheme, financial aid for the Prosthetic device to the disabled, financial assistance for self-employment to Disabled people, Grant for vocational training. The Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation has also announced Welfare schemes for persons with disabilities viz. Scholarship for the disabled, Free instruments to physically handicapped persons and deaf and dumb persons. Besides, under the Accessible India Campaign, the public buildings have been made accessible. Even the smart city project does not explicitly deal with or engage with the accessibility of streets, roads, etc., though there is a reference to making the localities walkable. Similarly, one of the strategies of the smart city project which needs to be highlighted is “retrofitting”, however, it is confined to an identified area of 500 acres or more. It is a matter of speculation whether the same can be employed to cover streets across the smart cities.

##### **_A6.1.1.4 Older People_**

Upon an extensive inquiry, we have not been able to find any scheme, initiative, or program which is specific to the Pune city; of course, we have limited our inquiry to initiatives of the Municipal Corporation of Pune. However, we have also found that the city of Pune is playing a catalyst role in availing the benefits to older people and persons with disabilities in various schemes and programs, introduced by either the Central government or the Government of Maharashtra. These schemes mostly provide small monthly pensions. To name these schemes – Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme,[^176] Indira Gandhi National Disability Pension Scheme,[^177] Sanjay Gandhi Niradhar Anudan Yojana[^178], Indira Gandhi National Widow Pension Scheme[^179]. During the pandemic, the Pune Municipal Corporation launched an initiative to provide essential groceries and medicines on a door-to-door basis for PWDs and older people. In this venture, the Corporation is being also assisted by the NGOs and active members of civil society. The Corporation also intends to provide direct cash transfer of INR 2000 in the accounts of PWDs and older people.[^180]

#### **_A6.1.2 Transport_**

We are not aware of any formal policy initiative adopted by the Municipal Corporation of Pune. However, suffice it to say that as a part of the State of Maharashtra, the city of Pune is under an obligation to implement the accessible public transport mandate under Sections 40 and 41 of the RPWD Act, 2016 which is discussed above in A 4.2  
Pune as a smart city has made headway by winning the sustainable transport award, 2020[^181] and is evident from its Urban Street design guidelines and Policy for Pedestrian Facilities and Safety in Pune City, January 2016 which is discussed above in part 6.1.1(b). Though not very transformative, it is indeed a baby step towards promoting inclusive public transport and these guidelines are more progressive than the Comprehensive Mobility pan for Pune, 2006 which even does not make an explicit reference either to universal design or PWDs or older people.

#### **_A6.1.3 Planning_**

In accordance with the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966, the Pune Municipal Corporation has enacted the Development Control and Promotion Regulations for Pune Municipal Corporation-2017. These Rules regulate the permissions of buildings. Normatively, these regulations refer to the National Building Code, but at the surface sound very ableist with a very crude definition of access (“Access” means a clear approach to a plot or a building)[^182]. The Rules also defines ‘Street/ Roads’ very broadly.[^183] But again, the Rules do not have any concrete provisions focusing on the universal design or accessibility of streets/roads.

#### **_A6.1.4 Structures for Stakeholder Involvement_**

To ensure percolation of ideals underlying the RPWD Act, 2016 till the grass-root level, the Act has put in place a normative institution of the District Level Committee. Under Section 72 of the RPWD Act, 2016 the State Government is under an obligation to constitute a District Level Committee, and by Rules, it has to specify the functions and its composition. As per draft rule number 31 of the Maharashtra State Rights of Persons with Disabilities Rules, 2019, the Government is required to involve stakeholders in the sphere of disability. Accordingly, the Guardian minister[^184] of the District is required to nominate Five members as representatives from registered organizations in the state representing each of the five groups of specified disabilities in the Schedule of the Act to be nominated by the Guardian minister of the State, such that at least two of them shall be persons with disability and there shall be minimum one female out of nominated representatives.

These nominated members must have expertise in rehabilitation, health, law, Industry and Services, and Sports and Arts of specified disabilities. Therefore, the stakeholders can make their way into this committee to realise the fusions of this law on the grass-root level. Normatively, there is a machinery in Maharashtra to ensure the District Level implementation of this Act, but whether such Committees have been constituted in all the districts of Maharashtra, is still not clear. In respect of pan India, according to a study undertaken in 2020 to study the implementation of the RPWD Act, 2016, it was found that only 9 provinces out of 29 provinces have enforced Section 72\. A careful analysis of the aforementioned provisions shows that, normatively, there is nothing wrong with the legal regime; however, the problem is with the implantation and the lack of interest shown by the provinces in performing rightfully the responsibilities delegated by the Parliament to implement this legislation. So far as the two sites of our project are concerned, there is a District Level Committee as envisaged by Section 72 and the Office of State Commission of Disability in Pune. Presently, the office is also occupied by the State Commissioner of Disability who is assisted by two Deputy Commissioners and the Advisory Committee is also in place to assist the commissioner in Pune. However, it is difficult to find out what concrete work has been done by the District Level Committee and the Commissioner in respect of accessibility of streets and transportation as there is hardly any information available in the public domain and on the website of the office of the Commissioner. There is no website of the District Level Committee nor we have come across any document.

### **A6.2 City 2; Delhi National Capital Territory**

#### **_A6.2.1 Equality and Inclusion_**

##### **_A6.2.1.1 Equality_**

We are not aware of any formal policy initiative adopted by the National Capital Territory of Delhi. However, suffice it to say that National Capital Territory of Delhi is under an obligation to implement the equality mandate under the RPWD Act, 2016 by taking into and orienting itself with Section 3 of the RPWD Act, 2016 which is discussed above in A 5.1.1 (a).

##### **_A6.2.1.2 Accessibility_**

As per the recommendation of the Working Group, the Governing Body of Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Plg. & Engg.) Centre (UTTIPEC), under the Chairmanship of Hon’ble Lt. Governor, has approved the “Pedestrian Design Guidelines” on 20.11.09 for immediate implementation, enforcement, and uniform adoption by all the road owning agencies. Before being recommended, these guidelines had entered into wider consultation in its various meetings with stakeholders and experts in the field of Urban Planning and Design. These guidelines are very detailed with six chapters and annexures. Since our focus is on PWDs and older people, the discussion below is confined to only the relevant parts of the guidelines.

In the context of busy traffic of Delhi, these guidelines are bound to be very important as their main objective is to enhance the comfort of pedestrians, minimize dependency on the cars, reduction in congestion and pollution, provide road connectivity to Metro Railway Stations, prioritization of public transport, etc. in the light of the fact that 40% of roads in Delhi having no sidewalks and 34% of its population engaging in ‘walk only’ trips, justifies the necessities of these guidelines. Focusing on PWDs, the guidelines cite a study by Samarthyam, an NGO. The responses recorded in this study are very telling – 58% of the disabled found steps, ramps, difficult to negotiate; 45% of elderly found steps and ramps daunting; 20%found uneven, narrow sidewalks difficult. Engineering guidelines for persons with disabilities are not implemented either. Chapter 5 dealing with the mandatory component of the design toolkit dedicates a section, i.e., Section 3 to Universal Accessibility features/barrier-free design. Highlighting the necessity of the principle of universal accessibility inter alia for PWDs, the guideline reads “Universal Accessibility is required for all sidewalks, crossings, parks, public spaces, and amenities – for people using wheelchairs, strollers, walkers, crutches, handcarts, bicycles, aged people, visually or hearing impaired, and pedestrians with temporary mobility impairment or injury”.

Like Pune guidelines, there are suggestions and recommendations in these guidelines, in respect of making streets accessible. The guidelines call for the installation of kerb ramps. Kerb ramps provide pedestrian access between the sidewalk and the roadway for people using wheelchairs, strollers, walkers, crutches, handcarts, bicycles, and pedestrians who have trouble stepping up and down high kerbs. Failure to provide kerb ramps would virtually prevent inter alia PWDs and older people from crossing the streets. In respect of Kerb- cut ramps to be user-friendly for PWDs, the following rules have to be obeyed – apart from stipulating the height and minimum width of the kerb ramps, the guideline recommends for tactile warning strip on the kerb side edge of the slope, to ensure that persons with vision impairment do not accidentally step onto the roads. Smoothness and flaredness of the ramps are imperative. A thorough periodical inspection must be conducted to ensure that gap is not developed between the gutter and the street surface. Per corner, two curb cuts are desirable. A single ramp located at the centre of the corner is less desirable, as separate ramps provide greater information to a pedestrian with vision impairment in street crossing. If the blocks are longer than 250 M, then the mid-block crossing should be provided for better accessibility for persons with disabilities. Taking into account the obstacles faced by people with visual impairment, the guidelines emphasize the installation of tactile paving. A continuous tactile guide facilitates a betterment in the excess of streets where footway crosses, larger open spaces, and when pedestrians need guidance around blocks. Apartment from detailing the quality (vitrified non-glazed) and, colour (preferably canary yellow) the guidelines of tactile paving mention the height of the paving (about 5mm), width (minimum 300 mm), and the distance (600-800 mm) from the edge of the footpath, the tactile paving should be free from obstructions like manholes, tree guards, lamp posts, etc. Tactile paving must be maintained to ensure that the profile does not erode, be it crossings, accessing directions to bus stops, toilets, road, lifts, or entry or exit to a facility like the foot over bridges, subways, public utility. The importance of tactile paving for facilitating the navigation of visually challenged persons cannot be underemphasized.

Audible crossing signals facilitate the persons with low vision and vision impairment to cross the streets safely and independently. To be effective, the installation of acoustic devices must be at the point of the origin of crossing rather than at the endpoint. Since escalators are not considered as inclusive, the guidelines emphasize having a staircase and ramps, or a staircase and elevator for universal accessibility. Like the Urban Street design guidelines, Pune, the Delhi guidelines also go into elaborate details of medians and refuge islands and their importance. Since the subject matter is more or less similar, it need not be repeated.

Cities like Pune and Delhi are notorious for encroachment of footpaths, either by hawkers or by unauthorized parking. Delhi guidelines suggest the creation of designated hawker zones to provide respite to the pedestrians on the footpath. Pedestrians and persons with disabilities, in particular, have to frequently undergo extreme hardships due to the digging work in the streets and on roads for the installation of public facilities like gas pipes, telephone and electricity poles, etc. Delhi guidelines emphasize careful planning of such public utilities to cause minimum disruptions to the street users. In respect of local bus stops, Delhi guidelines emphasize their universal accessibility as frequently PWDs and older people use public transport. The same is the case with metro railway stations. The Delhi guidelines talk about maps at bus and BRT and metro stations. They are conspicuously silent on making these maps accessible for PWDs and older people. The Guidelines also highlight the planned signages for effective navigation through the city. The guidelines also amplify the desirability of pelican crossings, i.e., pedestrian-initiated traffic lights to be installed at mid-block crossing to help the pedestrians and particularly physically handicapped.

Like the Urban Street design guidelines, Pune, the Delhi guidelines also attach importance to the traffic calming measures. The same is helpful for PWDs and older people. When we compare both these guidelines, we get the impression that Delhi guidelines are more elaborate; however, both guidelines need revision in the light of the RPWD Act, 2016

##### **_A6.2.1.3 Disability_**

As per the available information, the national capital territory of Delhi had not adopted any policy document till now for the effective implementation of the provisions of the RPWD Act, 2016, and the obligations incurred by the UNCRPD. However, the RPWD Act, 2016 being nationwide legislation, is equally applicable to Delhi.

##### **_A6.2.1.4 Older People_**

Upon visiting the website of the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC), it has been found that bus passes are provided to PWDs and senior citizens.[^185] A similar benefit is extended to PWDs and senior citizens in inter-state travels on couches run by DTC.[^186] There is also the Delhi old age pension scheme to provide financial assistance to PWDs and older people[^187]. There are Night Shelters for Homeless people in Delhi. The Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board is a nodal agency for the operation and management of the Night Shelter in the city of Delhi. The department has established 198-night shelters that are being operated in collaboration with various NGOs[^188]. During the pandemic and particularly during the lockdown, the initiative of the Delhi Government to provide food to older people and PWDs has received public attention. [^189]

#### **_A6.2.2 Transport_**

We have already discussed the relevant provisions pertaining to accessibility in the public transport under the RPWD Act, 2016, in part A 4.2 above and the obligation arising out of the same are also binding on the National Capital Territory of Delhi. Besides, along the lines of the National Urban Transport Policy which we have already analysed in part A 4.2 above, it has a spillover effect in the National Capital Territory Delhi too. The Transport Department of Delhi is entrusted with the responsibility of providing an efficient public transportation system and policy-making, coordination, implementation, monitoring, and regulatory functions of all the Transport related aspects of NCT of Delhi.[^190] Referring to an article[^191] analysing the transformation in Delhi in respect of accessibility, “Delhi Transport Corporation has also taken a lead in the field of construction of Bus Queue Shelter made with a user-friendly approach for disabled people. They have provided ramps on both sides of the bus queue and the height of the shelter has been so designed that its low height has been kept parallel to the low floor of the buses. This allows people with a wheelchair to commute without any assistance. Keeping in mind the accessibility by all, the Metros have been designed to be barrier-free for any kind of disability. The Metro is one of the prime public transport systems of Delhi as it is well spread throughout the city and is well connected to every major destination.”

Some Metros are also equipped with sign language with interpreters and an announcements system which is immensely useful to both hard of hearing and visually impaired people. Metro stations are equipped with wheelchair-enabled lifts and toilets. NGOs like SVAYAM, Nipun Foundation, SAMARTHYAM[^192], the National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People are making a huge difference with their active involvement in raising awareness about the issue of accessibility. To give an illustration, SAMARTHYAM has undertaken a project entitled, “National Centre for Accessible Environments,” wherein it evaluates, develops, and promotes universally accessible design inbuilt and outdoor environments, transportation systems, and public services.

#### **_A6.2.3 Planning_**

The planning department of Delhi operates through Annual plans and Five years plans[^193]. Inter alia, it performs the following functions;

- Monitoring, Appraisal & Review of Plan Schemes.

- Catalytic Role in the introduction of new strategies and approaches in planning

schemes.

- Release of funds to the local bodies.

- Administration approval & Expenditure sanction of the plan schemes/projects.

- Evaluation of the Plan Schemes.

- Twenty Point Programme.

- Estimation & Monitoring of Financial Resources including the Additional

Resources Mobilization for Annual Plans & Five-Year Plans of NCT of Delhi.

- Monitoring of physical & financial performance of the public sector entities of

GNCT of Delhi including Delhi Jal Board and Delhi Transport Corporation.

- Secretariat of the State Planning Board and Evaluation of the Advisory Committee.

- Management of the Planning and Statistical Cadre.

- Manpower Planning and the estimation of employment generation with reference

to the plan of implementation.

#### **_A6.2.4 Structures for Stakeholder Involvement_**

The discussion relevant to the City of Pune in A 6.1.4 is mutatis mutandis applicable to the National Capital Territory of Delhi.

# **B Laws that can be used only by or on behalf of pedestrians with specific characteristics**

## **B1 Actions under Constitution of India, 1950**

### **B1.1 Description and Examples**

In this section, we will deal with the Constitutional framework focusing on the prohibition of disability-based discrimination. It is to be noted that often the actions for discrimination under Article 14 of the Constitution overlap with Articles 19 and 21 as a Supreme Court has recognised in Minerva Mills v. Union of India that these three articles constitute golden triangle.

Under the Indian Constitution with reference to Article 14 guaranteeing equal protection of the law, actions may be brought in connection with the redressals pertaining to the accessibility of streets and allied matters. Article 14 may be invoked along with the RPWD Act, 2016 or independently. Similarly, a case can be made out for promoting accessibility during the planning and designing of streets by reading Article 14 along with Article 19 (1) (d) that guarantees the fundamental right to move throughout the territory of India. It is possible to argue that the inaccessibility of streets amounts to discrimination on the ground of physical and mental disability, as the planning and designing of the street exclude from the consideration, the needs of these groups. See A 4.1.1 Equality and Inclusion.

Although formally the text of non-discrimination regime under the Indian Constitution and the Supreme Court and High Court jurisprudence does not engage with or show awareness about indirect discrimination, recently in Lt. Col. Nitisha and others v. Union of India[^194], Justice D.Y. Chandrachud in his landmark judgment has finally incorporated the doctrine of indirect discrimination as a part of the non-discrimination regime in India. He very categorically emphasized the weakness of direct discrimination in arresting systemic discrimination which occurs without any formal discriminator. He also stressed that a facially neutral statute with the best of intentions may produce discriminatory effects under the impact of stereotyping and essentialism. In other words, he also took cognizance of the intent/effect dichotomy attaching great importance to the latter. Particularly, by invoking indirect discrimination, the statistical impact on a community or vulnerable group can be gauged. He endorsed the Canadian Supreme Court approach to the evolution of indirect discrimination in its decision of Fraser *v.* Canada (Attorney General).[^195] Once the petitioner establishes that the rule, in effect, creates a distinction on the basis of the protected ground, the second stage of the enquiry starts. At this stage, the Court asks whether: “the law has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating, or exacerbating disadvantage…The goal is to examine the impact of the harm caused to the affected group. The harm may include “\[e\]conomic exclusion or disadvantage, \[s\]ocial exclusion…\[p\]sychological harms…\[p\]hysical harms…\[or\] \[p\]olitical exclusion”, and must be viewed in light of any systemic or historical disadvantages faced by the claimant group (paragraph 76)”.[^196]

Though this case has been decided in the setting of gender, its significance in arresting the facially neutral policy of the state under the obsession of ableism cannot be lost sight of. The major advantage of indirect discrimination is to shift the focus away from formal equality and direct the attention of the Court to substantive equality. The decision of the Delhi High court discussed above providing relief to the blind student on missing his exam, is a very apt example of indirect discrimination. Ground of indirect discrimination is very much a cause of action because Article 15 and 16 read with Article 14 prohibits discrimination and therefore there is no textual barrier for introduction of indirect discrimination as a case of action. In fact without mentioning indirect discrimination as such the same has been brough in play by the Supreme Court in number of its earlier decisions e.g. rejecting the claim of Union Public Service Commission, perceiving blind persons to be completely ineligible from being considered for appointments as IAS officers, the Court recognized indirect discrimination. Under 141 of the Indian Constitution law declared by Supreme Court is binding on all courts and under Art 144 all the governmental authorities are obligated to assist the court in the implementation of its judgments. In light of section 3 of RPWD Act, 2016 prohibiting disability-based discretion it is categorical for the courts to deploy indirect discrimination as a cause of action.

**Article 21 Right to life and liberty**

Right to life guaranteed under the Constitution of India, 1950, it is appropriate to refer to the decision of the Supreme Court in Rajive Raturi v. Union of India. In this judgment, Justice A K Sikri observed[^197] “The vitality of the issue of accessibility vis-à-vis visually disabled person’s right to life can be gauged clearly by the Supreme Court’s judgment in Umed Ram Sharma[^198] where the right to life under Article 21 has been held broad enough to incorporate the right to accessibility.” The crux of this landmark judgment is that in the absence of the right to accessibility vis-à-vis PWDs, the right to freedom of movement is bound to remain an empty shell devoid of any empowerment. The point becomes even more strong if the linkage of Article 21 guaranteeing the right to life and personal liberty to all persons is sought with Article 19 (1) (d), as alluded above. For a detailed discussion of this case and other examples, see Part A 4.2 Transport. Can the right to life or personal liberty be meaningful in light of built-in barriers? Addressing this question, the court directed all the States/provinces and the Central government to issue compliance reports in respect of the adherence to the directions issued by it.

### **B1.2 Remedies, sanctions, or Other Outcomes**

In the absence of disability as an explicit ground of non-discrimination under the Constitution of India, the Courts have implied the same through Article 14 of the Constitution of India, and therefore, a case may be made for the violation of the Fundamental Rights by approaching either the Supreme Court under Article 32 or the High Courts under Article 226 by PWDs. Both Supreme and High Court may issue writ of mandamus, habaus corpus, certiorari, prohibition etc. to the government and against private parties for redressal of fundamental rights. The jurisdiction also empowers both these courts to issue directions or provide declaratory relief or even award compensation. Since the power of High Court goes beyond the violation of fundamental rights, if a PWDs is able to establish that she has exhausted all the statutory channels the High Court may intervene. Recently in Vikash Kumar v. UPSC, the Supreme Court has issued direction to all examination bodies and education institutions to avail reasonable accommodation to PWDs and to provide scribe to any person who requires so. The Court has also issued directions to Department for Empowerment PWDs to modify the scribe guidelines in light of its judgment. In a similar vein, the Bombay High Court has issued directions to State Government to expediate the reservation in promotion for PWDs.

### **B1.3 Enforcement**

**Enforcement mechanism- Constitution of India, 1950**

Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India, an aggrieved person can move Supreme Court of India directly for vindication of one’s fundamental right guaranteed under the Constitution. Since PWDs, older people and pedestrians with special characteristics have every right to take recourse to this provision. Article 226- Same power is available with High Courts under Article 226 with a difference that apart from fundamental rights even for any other purpose the High Courts can be moved by any aggrieved person under its jurisdiction. Besides, the Public Interest Litigation is another avenue for agitating against the violation of the Fundamental Rights of PWDs and any public-spirited individual or organisation can move the High Court or the Supreme Court through this avenue on behalf of them. The Delhi High Court took suo-moto cognizance of the plight of the visually impaired student who could not reach the University to write his M.Phil. examination because the compartment of the railway reserved for the disabled was closed. The Court issued direction to the Delhi University to conduct the exam within ten days from the date of the judgment and give such assistance, as permissible under the applicable rules, for undertaking the examination.[^199]

## **B2 Discrimination action under RPWD Act, 2016**

### **B2.1 Description and Examples**

With the ratification of the UNCRPD and the enactment of the RPWD Act, 2016, the duty of all the levels of government not to discriminate on the ground of physical and mental disability has been brought into sharp relief. Section 3 (3) of the RPWD Act, 2016 in its relevant part reads “(3) No person with disability shall be discriminated on the ground of disability ……………”. Section 12, 16 and 20 extend the principle of non-discrimination enunciated in Section 3 (3) to access to justice, educational institution and schools receiving government aid and public employment. However, since the Section 3(3) is a general prohibition it may be invoked in respect in actions on part of the central and provincial governments in the domain of accessibility by making out a case of unfair treatment or unequal treatment in respect of making transportation accessible or overlooking accessibility principles during street designs.

The 2016 Act also defines discrimination in Section 2 (h) which reads “(h) “discrimination” in relation to disability, means any distinction, exclusion, restriction on the basis of disability which is the purpose or effect of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise on an equal basis with others of all human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field and includes all forms of discrimination and denial of reasonable accommodation”.[^200] The definition of discrimination under the RPWD Act, 2016 is a replica of its counterpart under the UNCRPD. This definition is very broad and has the potential to cover both direct and indirect discrimination. The Act has adopted a trifurcated approach to defining persons with disabilities, who are the beneficiaries under this Act. The trifurcation is based on the escalation in the severity of a disability. By way of the first step of the ladder is the notion of a person with a disability. Same is defined as “(s) “person with disability” means a person with long term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairment which, in interaction with barriers, hinders his full and effective participation in society equally with others”. This definition is replicated from UNCRPD. However, neither the Act nor the rules provide any guidance about the notion of the ‘long term’. Interestingly, the Act does not also define ‘impairment’. However, a number of impairments have been enlisted to the schedule attached to this Act by characterizing the same as specified disabilities. Technically and theoretically, therefore, it misses the important distinction between impairments and disability.

The Act also defines ‘barrier’ very broadly to fully capture the interaction between impairment and any factor which hampers the full and effective participation of persons with disabilities in society. It is important to note that PWDs enjoy all other rights and facilities guaranteed by the RPWD Act, 2016 except rights and facilities guaranteed to persons with benchmark disabilities and “person with a disability having high support needs. The rights and facilities which can be availed by PWDs are broadly described in CHAPTER II, III, and IV; viz Section 3 – Equality and non-discrimination, Section 5 – Community life, Section 6 – Protection from cruelty and inhuman treatment, Section 7 – Protection from abuse, violence, and exploitation, Section 8 – Protection and safety, Section 9 – Home and family, Section 10 – Reproductive rights, Section 11 – Accessibility in voting, Section 12 – Access to justice, Section 13 – Legal capacity, Section 16 – Duty of educational institutions towards children with disabilities, Section 20 – Non-discrimination in employment. Moreover, duties and responsibilities cast on the levels of governments inter alia contain an obligation to provide accessibility and access to transport which apply to a person with a disability, irrespective of whether they fall under the category of person with benchmark disability or a person with a disability having high support needs. In short, the centre of gravity of the RPWD Act, 2016 is a person with a disability and the government has to be wary of not stretching the meaning of the concept of benchmark disability and a person with a disability having high support needs, beyond their context.

By way of the second step on the ladder is the definition of “person with benchmark disability”. It is defined as “(r) “person with benchmark disability” means a person with not less than forty percent of a specified disability where specified disability has not been defined in measurable terms and includes a person with disability where specified disability has been defined in measurable terms, as certified by the certifying authority”. A close look at this definition demonstrates two types of disabilities, viz specified disabilities which are defined in measurable terms, and specified disabilities which have been defined in measurable terms, and in such cases protection of this Act is contingent on a certificate to be issued by the certifying authority that a particular specified disability is not less than 40%. The term specified is important because it delimits the number of disabilities to be covered by the Act. There are four specified disabilities which are defined in measurable terms viz. (c) "dwarfism" means a medical or genetic condition resulting in an adult height of 4 feet 10 inches (147 centimetres) or less; B. Visual impairment— (a) "blindness" means a condition where a person has any of the following conditions, after best correction— (i) Total absence of sight; or (ii) visual acuity less than 3/60 or less than 10/200 (Snellen) in the better eye with best possible correction; or (iii) limitation of the field of vision subtending an angle of less than 10 degrees. (b) "low-vision" means a condition where a person has any of the following conditions, namely: — (i) visual acuity not exceeding 6/18 or less than 20/60 up to 3/60 or up to 10/200 (Snellen) in the better eye with best possible corrections; or (ii) limitation of the field of vision subtending an angle of less than 40 degrees up to 10 degrees. C. Hearing impairment— (a) "deaf" means persons having 70 DB hearing loss in speech frequencies in both ears; (b) "hard of hearing" means a person having 60 DB to 70 DB hearing loss in speech frequencies in both ears;” It is important to note that these disabilities having been defined in measurable terms, the ones falling in the same, need not require any certification of the percentage of their disability.

On the other hand, there are 17 other disabilities specified in the schedule annexed to the Act but these disabilities having been defined and explained in non-measurable terms, persons falling in any of the same have to obtain a certificate that his or her disability is not less than 40 percent. It is also necessary to bear in mind that the category of benchmark disability is deployed in the RPWD Act, 2016 for a specific purpose, i.e., to confer certain rights and facilities on PWDs who can be indicated as persons with benchmark disability. Persons with benchmark disability enjoy following the rights to the exclusion of other persons with disability. Section 31 Right to Free education for children with benchmark disabilities within the age group of 6 to 18 years; Section 32 not less than five percent. seats for persons with benchmark disabilities in higher education institutions; Section 17 (h) reads “to provide scholarships in appropriate cases to students with benchmark disability”, Section 34 not less than four percent of the total number of vacancies in the cadre strength in each group of posts to be filled with persons with benchmark disabilities in Government Establishment, Section 33 Identification of posts for reservation as per Section 34, Section 35 provision for incentives to an employer in the private sector employing not less than five percent of their workforce with persons with benchmark disability. There are provisions like the establishment of the Special employment exchange (Section 36), and the Special schemes and development programmes like (Section 37\) (a) five percent reservation in the allotment of agricultural land and housing in all the relevant schemes and development programmes, with appropriate priority given to the women with benchmark disabilities; (b) five percent reservation in all poverty alleviation and various developmental schemes, with priority to the women with benchmark disabilities; (c) five percent reservation in the allotment of land on concessional rate, where such land is to be used for the purpose of promoting housing, shelter, setting up of occupation, business, enterprise, recreation centres, and production centres. By way of the third step of the ladder is (t) “person with a disability having high support needs” means a person with benchmark disability certified under clause (a) of sub-section (2) of Section 58 who needs high support. High support is defined in Section 2 as “(l) “high support” means an intensive support, physical, psychological and otherwise, which may be required by a person with benchmark disability for daily activities, to take independent and informed decision to access facilities and participating in all areas of life including education, employment, family and community life and treatment and therapy”. A close reading of Sections 2 (t) and 58(2)(a) makes it clear that only a person with a benchmark disability can be certified as a person with a disability having high support needs. In other words, the legislature has assumed that a PWD whose disability is less than 40% or if it is not a specified disability then he/she cannot be certified as a person with a disability having high support needs.

To identify the duty bearers under the RPWD Act, 2016, it is necessary to have a close look at the definitions of appropriate Government, establishment, and government establishment. “(b) “appropriate Government” means, — (i) in relation to the Central Government or any establishment wholly or substantially financed by that Government, or a Cantonment Board constituted under the Cantonments Act, 2006 (41 of 2006), the Central Government; (ii) in relation to a State Government or any establishment, wholly or substantially financed by that Government, or any local authority, other than a Cantonment Board, the State Government” (i) “establishment” includes a Government establishment and private establishment; (k) “Government establishment” means a corporation established by or under a Central Act or State Act or an authority or a body owned or controlled or aided by the Government or a local authority or a Government company as defined in Section 2 of the Companies Act, 2013 (18 of 2013\) and includes a Department of the Government; (v) “private establishment” means a company, firm, cooperative or other society, associations, trust, agency, institution, organisation, union, factory or such other establishment as the appropriate Government may, by notification, specify.” There is no provision in the RPWD Act, 2016 which explicitly deals with private establishments; in fact, the enforcement of this law against the private establishment is subject to the issuance of a notification by the appropriate government as defined above. A close look at these definitions, therefore, makes it clear that by and large, the duty holder under the RPWD Act, 2016 are all levels of government and governmental instrumentalities. Its application to the private sector or private establishment is unclear. Though, a case can be made out for an obligation of non-discrimination under Section 20 of the RPWD Act, 2016 or in respect of service providers by invoking Article 14 of the Constitution of India.

On this background, it is appropriate to briefly discuss the duty to provide reasonable accommodation which is one of the inherent elements of non-discrimination and its noncompliance or denial is deemed to be discrimination on the grounds of disability. The same is defined in Section 2(y) of the RPWD Act, 2016 as “reasonable accommodation” means necessary and appropriate modification and adjustments, without imposing a disproportionate or undue burden in a particular case, to ensure to persons with disabilities the enjoyment or exercise of rights equally with others”. The absence of reference to the auxiliary aids is conspicuous in this definition. Though this definition is generic, to what level of generalization the concept of reasonable accommodation will be stretched is not clear and is subject to the interpretation placed by the courts, particularly vis-à-vis accessibility, what is the threshold for the invocation of reasonable accommodation is a critical question, awaiting an answer.

In our opinion, reasonable accommodation is a dimension of individualized justice that should be invoked in a particular case by striking a balance between the rights of PWDs and the number of resources to be allocated by the establishment or service provider. In India, we do not have a detailed guidance or a reasonable accommodation policy. Compared with this definition, the definition of Reasonable accommodation in the 2011 working draft of the Rights of Persons with Disability Bill was far more inclusive, sensitive, and was influenced by its counterpart Equality Act, 2010 (UK). The working draft definition reads “(y) ‘Reasonable Accommodation’ means: (i) where a provision, criterion or practice puts a person to whom one or more prohibited grounds apply at a disadvantage in relation to a relevant matter in comparison with other persons, to take such steps as it is reasonable to have to take to avoid the disadvantage; (ii) where a physical feature puts a person to whom one or more prohibited grounds apply at a disadvantage in relation to a relevant matter in comparison with other persons, to take such steps as it is reasonable to have to take to avoid the disadvantage; (iii) where a person to whom one or more prohibited grounds apply would, but for the provision of an auxiliary aid, be put at a disadvantage in relation to a relevant matter in comparison with other persons, to take such steps as it is reasonable to have to take to provide the auxiliary aid; (iv) where clause (i) or (iii) above relates to the provision of information, the steps which it is reasonable to have to take include steps for ensuring that in the circumstances concerned the information is provided in an accessible format. Provided that the particular requirements of women with disabilities shall in no case be seen as imposing a disproportionate or undue burden.”

In this connection, a reference must also be made to Section 45 (2) of the RPWD Act, 2016\. In its relevant part, it reads “The appropriate Government and the local authorities shall formulate and publish an action plan based on prioritization, for providing accessibility in all their buildings and spaces providing essential services such as all primary health centres, civil hospitals, schools, railway stations and bus stops.

**Action for accessible campus**

The Bombay High Court in Akanksha Vardhaman Kale v. Union of India[^201], converted a petition filed by wheelchair-bound petitioner into a Public Interest Litigation to bring on anvil inaccessible campuses of college and universities catering higher education in the State of Maharashtra. Inter alia, the High Court insisted on adherence to Sections 40 and 44 of the RPWD Act, 2016 and the National Building Code. Issuing a series of directions, the Court observed “The State and the Director of Education shall issue instructions to all the Universities to call for compliance report from the educational institutions. In case any completion certificates in respect of the structures, institutions, establishments/buildings as required by the Act are pending with the authorities, then the necessary compliance be sought before issuing the occupancy or completion certificates. In case the occupancy or completion certificates of such buildings was already granted, then such authorities would take necessary steps for creating basic facilities like ramp, washrooms, barrier free access for handicapped persons in such buildings.”[^202] Although it is a salutary judgment at its face value, in terms of structural headways it does little. The use of the word ‘handicapped’ shows the level of sensitivity of the judges of the High Court. Neither does the judgment go far enough in attaching sanctions for the non-compliance with its directions, nor does the State Commissioner for Disability or Provincial Government appear to have collaborated in the matter by proving incentives to education institutions and universities falling in line with the above directions.

Recently, a petition has been filed in the Delhi High Court by Himanshu Goswami against the University of Delhi. The petition related to the difficulties being faced by the visually impaired persons in navigating the pavements inter alia in the North Campus area. Interestingly, the court has not made any reference to Sections 40 or 44 of the RPWD Act, 2016\. Instead, it has referred to "Guidelines for Pedestrian Facilities" published by the Indian Roads Congress in the year May 2012, and has directed the University authorities and the Delhi Municipal Corporation to adhere to the same. In very pithy observations, the court has displayed the pathetic approach of the authorities “6. We also find that the authorities are shifting responsibility from one to another. While some pavements are claimed to be under the jurisdiction of Municipal Corporation, the responsibility of others is shifted to the Public Works Department.”[^203] Despite having exposed the caviler approach of the Respondent the court has preferred to fall back on them to file status reports of the actual steps taken by them to make all the buildings/installations disabled-friendly as well as firm action plans setting out the timelines within which the same shall be completed. This approach of the court is very paradoxical. To get the feel of the ground realities, the court directed that the two campuses, i.e., the North Delhi Campus and South Delhi Campus of the University of Delhi to be treated as pilot projects. It directed the Commissioners of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation and South Delhi Municipal Corporation as well as the Engineers \- in \- Chief of the PWD to cause a joint physical inspection of all pavements around these two campuses and to submit an action plan to ensure that they are made disabled-friendly. It further directed to take steps forthwith to ensure that all obstructions rendering pavements inaccessible are removed. The court reminded the authorities of their obligation by observing “These authorities ought to examine the guidelines suggested by the Indian Roads Congress which note the requirement of the informal commercial activities on the footpaths and the need of integrating it with the design of the footpath facility. If this was properly done the disabled pedestrian would have no difficulty. It is the unstructured, unplanned and hap hazard obstructions which are causing the difficulties.”[^204] “It is made clear that continuity of the tactile pavement markings shall be ensured so that there is safe passage for visually impaired persons.”[^205]

A close look at this judgment shows that the court has reposed faith in physical inspection rather than directing the authorities to go for an access audit. Besides, there appears to be a general tendency amongst the judges to deal with accessibility as a general issue rather than treating it as a sub-matter involving expertise. To put it briefly the courts have undermined the role of access auditors. We have already referred to an important judgement of Nipun Malhotra v. Government of NCT, Delhi in respect of procurement of low-floor accessible buses for physically disabled. See A 4.2

The Gauhati High Court delivered an exemplary judgment in Arman Ali V. Union of India[^206] and Others. In this case, an NGO ‘Shishu Sarothi’, stood for the rights of a person with Cerebral Palsy to access a private gym. The petitioner complained of discrimination on the ground of disability by the gym authorities. Although the gym authorities tried to argue that being a private establishment, they were beyond the purview of Article 12 of the Constitution of India and thereby beyond the writ jurisdiction of the High Court. The High Court rejected this argument by construing the phrases ‘public building and public facilities’ broadly to even include private establishments like a gym. The court emphasized raising awareness of the officials of the Province of Assam and inter alia directed “Commissioner and Secretary of the Social Welfare Department, Government of Assam to “issue general circulars to all Government and private establishments highlighting the salient features of the 2016 Act and to ensure that public buildings and public facilities and services are accessible by persons with disabilities. Such directions or guidelines may be issued within a period of 2 (two) months from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this order.”[^207] Exceptionally the Gauhati High Court also decided to give a biting effect to its judgment by holding “Before closing the litigation, Court is of the view that some cost may be imposed both on the State as well as on respondent No. 6\. Respondent No. 6 through a private entity has also a duty to ensure that its facilities are friendly to the differently abled. Accordingly, both respondent Nos. 3 and 6 are directed to pay Rs. 50,000 each to the Shishu Sarothi which will be used for the benefit of the specially abled children who are attending classes in the said centre. Let the deposit of Rs. 50,000 each be made by respondent No. 3 and respondent No. 6 within a period of 2 months from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this order.”[^208]

### **B2.2 Remedies, Sanctions or Other Outcomes**

Some of the remedies which can be availed by bringing actions under aforementioned provisions of RPWD Act, 2016 are declarations, injunctions, orders, award of compensation etc. e.g. under Section 16 of RPWD Act if a government aided school refuses to provide admission to a student with disability then an action may be brought for seeking direction against such a school to admit the concerned student. Similarly, if the public transportation system in the city does not adhere to accessibility standards an action may be brough under section 3(3) for denial of equal treatment along with enforcement of right to accessibility under section 40 and 41 of RPWD Act, 2016\.

### **B2.3 Enforcement**

The RPWD Act, 2016 has in place the enforcement machinery by way of the Grievance Redressal Officer (Section 23). State Commissioner for Disability (Section 79), Chief Commissioner for Disability (Section 74), the appointment of Public Prosecutor or advocate trained in disability rights jurisprudence (Section 85). During the pandemic, the Chief Commissioner for Disability had decided to conduct the proceedings virtually to hear grievances of PWDs.[^209]

**Chief and State/Provincial Commissioners for Disabilities**

The Commissioners at Central and Provincial levels have all the powers of a Civil Court to conduct an investigation. Their offices may be moved by any aggrieved person to seek inquiry into the deprivation of rights of PWDs. The commissioner may also seek inquiry suomoto. Besides, they are authorised to review the safeguards provided under the RPWD Act, 2016 or other laws for the protection of the rights of persons with disabilities and recommend measures for their effective implementation. They can also review the factors that inhibit the enjoyment of rights of persons with disabilities and recommend appropriate remedial measures. In order to perform functions effectively and to ensure that discussion reached by them reflects the lived experiences of PWDs, the Central and Provincial Governments are required to constitute Advisory Committees to assist the Chief Commissioners and Commissioners in the provinces, comprising of not more than eleven members drawn from the experts from different disabilities.[^210] This is another avenue for providing space to PWDs and to have their concerns addressed by the Government. The Chief Commissioner of PWDs does not stand in a hierarchical relationship with state commissions. Rather it keeps a watch on matters following within the domain of Central Government. So far as the recognition and enforcement of the Right to accessibility are concerned, the role of the Chief Commissioner of PWDs is vital. The Central Government is obligated to make/formulate rules for persons with disabilities, laying down the standards of accessibility for the physical environment, transportation, etc. in consultation with the Chief Commissioner. The issues of structural and systemic discrimination can be tackled readily under indirect discrimination regime and can be brought into play by both Courts and Commissioners under RPWD Act, 2016 while entertaining the complaints of PWDs. The regime of indirect discrimination is a very effective tool to problematize the adversarial form of dispute resolution and to incentivize collaborative activism of the authorities of the government

**Reporting Mechanism: Under Section 78 and 83 of RPWD Act, 2016** the Chief Commissioner and the Commissioner at provinces are obligated to submit an annual report to the Central and provincial Government respectively. Additionally, in cases of urgency or importance, they have the power to submit special reports on any matter.

The Central or provincial Government is under an obligation to lay such reports along with a memorandum of action taken or proposed to be taken on the recommendations of the Chief Commissioner/ Commissioner at provinces or the reasons for non-acceptance of the recommendations, before both the Houses of the Parliament or State Legislature as the case may be. Besides the Act also provides for establishment of a special Court for PWDs under Section 84 of RPWD Act, 2016\. For discussion, see A 5.1 (c). The RPWD Act, 2016 also confers a number of civil rights[^211] which due to their overlapping nature may be termed as ‘human rights and fundamental rights’ and for vindication of these rights jurisdictions of both civil courts, criminal courts and High Courts and Supreme Courts may be invoked. Besides Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, National Commission for Women Act, 1990, Schedule Caste and Schedule Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, also have machinery for enforcement of these rights as India follows multi-axis remedial machinery for different vulnerable groups. See Section B 4\.

Under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 both the victims or the National/State Human Rights Commission may approach to vindicate their rights and the NHRC is empowered to award interim compensation under Section 18\. With reference to our project, complaints pertaining to open potholes on roads may be entertained at both the national and provincial level human Rights Commissions. Under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, there is a provision for the constitution of a Human Rights Court in every District and the Provincial Governments are also obligated to appoint special public prosecutor trained in Human Rights (Sections 30 and 31 respectively).[^212] The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) constituted under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 has set up a Core Group representing various disabilities to identify important human rights issues concerning disabled persons, to review policies adopted so far by the Central and Provincial Governments, and suggest possible interventions by the National Human Rights Commission along with the nature of strategies to be adopted[^213]. In 2006, a Complaint was filed with NHRC, by a person who is totally wheelchair-bound as a result of a spinal injury in a road accident and got both of his limbs paralyzed. His grievance is that the car manufacturing companies have discontinued manufacturing vehicles for the physically challenged persons causing hindrance to those who want to be self-dependent. Particularly, he attracted the attention of the NHRC about the neutral approach of Maruti Udyog Limited which is a public sector undertaking and a premier car manufacturing company of India. Acting on this Complaint, the NHRC sought comments from the Secretary, Ministry of Heavy Industries for his comments within three weeks.[^214] Unfortunately, there is no record available on the website of NHRC about the further progress in the compliant.

However, upon our research, we have found out that the Motor Vehicle Amendment Act, 2019, has introduced Adapted Vehicles in Section 2 and alteration provisions under Section 52\. In the 56th meeting of the Central Motor Vehicle Rules- Technical Standing Committee highlighted the need to formulate a procedure for adapted vehicles of category M1 (Category M1: Means a motor vehicle used for the carriage of passengers, comprising not more than eight seats in addition to the driver's seat). This standard has been formulated covering adaptations for the vehicle of category M1 covering requirements for accommodation and accessibility for driver and passengers of reduced mobility.[^215] It appears that for want of incentives, very few car manufacturing companies are ready to make modifications to the vehicle at the manufacturing stage. The great disadvantage of the same is the denial of an exemption from Excise Tax and another levy as these concessions are contingent on modifications of vehicles during the manufacturing process of the vehicles themselves. In other words, retrofitting does not merely amount to the loss of these concessions but also makes the vehicle disqualified from claiming any warranty. Hopefully, the implementation of new draft guidelines and suitable changes in the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 would help to resolve these issues.

In another instance, the NHRC took suo-moto cognizance of a news item captioned "Disabled Girl raped at home" which appeared in a national daily dated 17 December 2004\. The Commission had asked the Director-General of Police, Kolkata, West Bengal to look into the allegation contained in the news story and submit his comments within two weeks. Unfortunately, the record about the further updates of this case is not available.[^216] Taking suo-moto cognizance of a newspaper report about denial of admission to a blind student in a degree course in college run by the Government of Andhra Pradesh, the NHRC directed the Secretary, Department of Education, Government of Andhra Pradesh to look into the matter and submit comments. Upon the notice of the NHRC, the provincial government permitted the Director of School Education, Hyderabad to allot a seat to the candidate as a special case[^217].

**Enforcement mechanism- Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987**

Legal aid and advice are the two important forms of support that would empower PWDs to vindicate their rights through the courts of law. Under Section 12 of The Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, persons with disabilities are entitled to avail legal services, including the services of a lawyer.[^218]

## **B3 Noteworthy Project-Related Observations and Concerns**

Project related concerns can be broadly classified in to mainly two categories i.e., attitudinal deficit and lack of effective enforcement mechanism. The right to accessibility being a very recent addition in the vocabulary of the Indian legal order to sink in with the law of India, it has to be given some time both in terms of its adherence as well as enforcement. There is a coordination issue with different ministries being at cross purposes with one another in respect of the interpretation of the RPWD Act, 2016 and the Mental Health Care Act, 2017\. To illustrate the two arms of the Government, the Union Public Service Commission and the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment have contrasting positions on the important question of whether a person with writer’s cramp be considered as persons with disability and stretch the matter to the extent of arguing it before the Supreme Court. Expressing anguish about the same the Supreme Court observed “We express our disquiet about the fact that, in a policy matter with profound consequences for India’s disabled population, the left hand does not know what the right one is doing.” The Court wonders why the issue of empowerment of the marginalized section should result in adversarial bickering.[^219]

If this is not enough, there is also a lack of empathy on the part of the highest court itself, as in one of its opinions it doubted the reading and writing ability of blind persons while tackling the important issue whether blind persons can be appointed as judges in lower courts.[^220] Despite a clear shift in favour of the social model of disability, still a lot of emphasis is put on locating disabilities in the body resulting in less attention on socio-political barriers. Moreover, over emphasis on medical model also tends to overlook particular those disabilities like blood disorders or multiple sclerosis which are not clearly visible outwardly. This is particularly true in respect of people with mental disabilities. Discrimination arising in the consequence of disability may have various shades. A person though may have a disability but if the same being hidden (patently not noticeable) he may be regarded as non-disabled. On the other hand, due to her accompaniment with PWDs the former may also be perceived as disabled. Despite the cure of disability, due to the stigma attached to the impairment embodied in a person, he may still be regarded as disabled, e.g., in India leprosy cured persons face a lot of discrimination and they are disqualified from holding many public offices including the membership of a co-operative society and the office of a panchayat[^221]. Section 3(3) of the RPWD Act, 2016 which we have already discussed, lacks the complexity to make inroads into the kind of nuances of discrimination we have just referred to.[^222] In short, though the claims of direct discrimination on the ground of physical and mental disability are usually tackled by the court, the more nuanced types of discrimination do not often reach the doorsteps of the court. e.g., in V. Surendra Mohan v. State of Tamil Nadu[^223], the Court characterized the appointment of blind persons to the position of judges in lower courts as an avoidable complication by completely overlooking the angle of reasonable accommodation and by endorsing the ableist viewpoint about the lack of competence of blind persons to act as judges.

By way of a rare example of empathy, Justice D. Y Chandrachud recently overruled this judgment in Vikash Kumar v. Union Public Service Commission and Ors.[^224]. And his observations on the complaint of the Supreme Court about so-called avoidable complications is worth reproducing “_Specifically, the_ relevant question, under the reasonable accommodation analysis, is not whether complications will be caused by the grant of a reasonable accommodation. By definition, reasonable accommodation demands departure from the status quo and hence ‘avoidable complications’ are inevitable. The relevant question is whether such accommodations would give rise to a disproportionate or undue burden. The two tests are entirely different.” Implicit in this observation is a very vital point. Only in an ableist environment is the interaction with the people with disabilities perceived as an avoidable complication. Because by default, the environment is exclusionary and does not even take cognizance of diversity, leave alone demonstrating any sensitivity to the special needs of a particular individual. By this pronouncement, Justice Chandrachud has categorically conveyed a legal message to the policymakers to regard reasonable accommodation as one of the in-built elements of inclusive equality.[^225]

**Multi-axis remedial machinery:** India follows multi-axis remedial machinery for different vulnerable groups. The main advantage of the multi-axis system is that it does not impose a load of cases only on one authority. But the disadvantage is that each authority looks at vulnerability in part vis-à-vis a particularly vulnerable section rather than as a whole. To use jargon, multi-axis machinery cannot adequately capture principle of intersectionality while providing redressal. To illustrate this, point the following discussion of remedial legislations is useful. Under the National Commission for Women Act, 1990, the commission at the Central level has been constituted and any aggrieved person can move this Commission to file complaints. The Commission has powers of the civil court to conduct inquiry and recommend action to the Central government (Section 10). In the province of Maharashtra, under the Maharashtra Commission for Women Act, 1993[^226], the commission at the provincial level is constituted with the same powers. (Section 10). The Parliament has also enacted The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013[^227] enabling women to vindicate hostile work environment and seek redressal against sexual harassment at the workplace. To provide protection to women in family settings and against the violence behind closed doors of the houses, Parliament has enacted the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005.[^228] This Act institutes a number of civil remedies by way of a protection order (Section 18).

There is also a provision for the appointment of a protection officer.[^229] Under the Commissions for Protection of Child Rights Act, 2005[^230], the National and State Commission for Protection of Child Rights have been constituted. The Commissions have powers of the civil court to conduct inquiry and recommend action to the Central and State governments. The Act mandates the constitution of Children’s court (Section 25\) to take cognizance of offences committed under the Act. The Provincial government is also obliged to appoint a special public prosecutor trained in Child Rights in these courts. (Section 26). The Parliament has also enacted The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 to deal with the social menace of sexual abuse of children.[^231] The Parliament has also enacted The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.[^232] The main objective underlying this law is to recognise the aggravated form of the vulnerability of people belonging to Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe. The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007.[^233] Under this Act, children are obligated to provide maintenance to parents who are senior citizens due to old age. For the enforcement of this obligation is there is a provision for the establishment of a Maintenance Tribunal (Section 7). Recently, the Supreme Court of India has issued directions attending to the Senior citizens in respect of payment of the pensions and regular availability of sanitizers, masks, and medicines to them. These directions are issued to both the Central and Provincial governments. The Court issued these directions filed by a senior Advocate.[^234] The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019[^235] has been enacted by the Parliament in response to the judgment of the Supreme Court in NALSA v. Union of India. The Act provides for the protection of the rights of transgender persons and their welfare. This Act recognises all the vital civil rights viz. the right to non-discrimination, right to education, right to health care facilities, etc. To deal with the complaint of the victims, the Act provides for the appointment of a complaints officer.

**Right to Accessibility**

Even though right to accessibility is recognized under RPWD Act, 2016 till it is anchored with universal design and perceived as diversity enhancing measure it is bound to remain a paper tiger. It is noteworthy that both the PWD Act, 1995 and the RPWD Act, 2016 have many provisions dealing with this important right. However, its realization is contingent as mentioned above. It is also necessary to raise the threshold of this right beyond the construction of ramps, wheelchair-friendly toilets, or tact-tiled pavements. Till society does not entertain a belief that PWDs should also navigate as a part of social intercourse and amend the notion of perceiving them as less eligible the idea of conceiving accessible streets may remain confined to drawings in manuals and big talks in the conferences. The disability rights movement is heavily dependent on either the individual litigants or public interest litigation for the judicial enforcement of this right. It is not easy to raise resources and the inaccessibility of judicial structures adds to the difficulties. Additionally, in absence of litigation culture and awareness of one’s rights, it is very seldom that one finds the appearance of the disabled litigant in the courts. There is also an issue of a lack of sensitivity among both judges and lawyers in comprehending the idea of accessibility. Of course, at the non-judicial level, we have a number of NGOs who have undertaken several studies or even the government has initiated accessibility audits but mostly the suggestions and the outcomes arising out of these, have not been properly addressed or implemented. See discussion in Section 4.2 Transport. Under the guise of economic capacity or development often the deadlines for targets are pushed thereby taking the bite out of the teeth of the law and the same is easily demonstrable from the study of relevant provisions setting targets in the RPWD Act, 2016 and accessible India campaign. The Supreme Court has also expressed its anguish about the same is Rajive Raturi Case, for discussion see section 4.2 Transport.

In light of the discretionary tone of the provisions of the law, it is often difficult to fix accountability and particularly to hold officials accountable through a particular timeline. It is also worrying that despite India having ratified UNCRPD, hardly any effort seems to have been made to collect statistics of road accidents or enlist accessibility deficit hurdles on the roads. Statistics in respect of both these matters is necessary not only for shaping policy but also to design machinery for securing justice. The department of law and justice does not have a dedicated portal to provide follow up of cases or actions either taken by PWDs themselves or by public-spirited individuals on their behalf. Even the follow-up of state-initiated actions is often missing thereby making it difficult for researchers to gather data for suggesting intervention.

Last but not least, though the RPWD Act 2016 came into force in 2016 it is grossly under implemented in the sense that hardly any province including the province of Maharashtra has even made any basic rules for its implementation. Understandably being a welfare legislation RPWD Act is mostly skeletal and its success is contingent on the initiation of schemes, programs and policies after proper and wider consultation with stakeholders. Till the same happens the law is bound to mostly remain a dead letter. This may be highlighted by citing a report titled as Two Years of The Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPWD) Act 2016 \- Status of implementation in the States and Union Territories of India[^236] by Disability Rights India Foundation (DRIF) in collaboration with National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People (NCPEDP) and National Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (NCRPD) with the support of Titan Company Limited. The main highlights of this report are; based on the responses from 24 States and UTs, the major findings were: 1\. The majority of the States (58.3%) have not notified the State Rules, despite the Act mandating that it should be notified within six months of the enforcement of the Act. 2\. Government has translated the Act only in two languages, i.e., Hindi and Odiya, out of 21 official languages. (The Act has been translated by NCPEDP in 9 languages and Sign Language). 3.50% of the States and UTs have not constituted State Advisory Boards (SAB) and 83.3% have not constituted the District Committees. 4\. 37.5% of the States have not appointed Commissioners for Persons with Disabilities. Even in the 62.5% of the States where there are Commissioners, the progress has not been substantial. The reason could be that many States do not have full-time commissioners. Only 3 states (12.5%) have constituted Advisory Committees comprising of experts, to assist the State Commissioner. 5\. 79.2% of the States have not constituted the State Fund for implementing the Act. 6\. Only 4 States (16.7%) have appointed a Nodal Officer in the District Education Office to deal with all matters relating to admission of children with disabilities. 7\. 58.3% of the States have not notified Special Courts in the Districts to try offences under the Act and 87.5% have not appointed Special Public Prosecutors as mandated by the law. 8\. 87.5% of the States do not have Designated Authorities to decide the nature and manner of support to persons with high support needs for exercising their legal capacity. 9\. As per the Act, every establishment (private and government) has to formulate an Equal Opportunity Policy and register it with the Disables Commissioner. However, 91.7% of States have reported NIL to the question as to how many Equal Opportunity policies that they have received from the Government. Only two States \- Delhi and Himachal Pradesh have reported they have received 1244 and 1 Equal Opportunity policy respectively from the establishments. 54.2% have not issued notifications for increasing reservation in employment from 3% to 4% in the government and public sectors. 10\. Only one state has taken some action with regard to providing increased quantum of assistance by (at least twenty-five percent) for people with disabilities in social security schemes. Only 50% Of the States have started issuing disability certificates pertaining to the new disabilities that have been added to the Act.

Finally, since the disability legislation in India is mainly directed against the government or its instrumentalities to generate a spillover effect affecting the private realm, post of incentives have to be initiated by the legislature and government. One of them is to evolve disability sensitive law of torts enabling the PWDs to initiate litigation against both the government and private sector for negligence and to fix liability for enforcement of right to accessibility. In our opinion inaction of the government on inaccessibility of streets and roads must be perceived by the courts as non-feasance.

# **C Laws that can be used by pedestrians generally or by NGOs on behalf of pedestrians generally**

## **C1 Failing to safeguard pedestrians from holes, roadworks, traffic flow, and other hazards**

### **C1.1 Common Law Negligence**

India is one of the members of Commonwealth and by adherence to common law tradition, the Indian legal order recognizes uncodified law of Torts. However, the legal culture in India being more or less reconciliatory or indifferent to Civil Wrongs in general and the law of Torts, in particular, the doctrinal level of the law of Torts is not as sophisticated in India as in the countries like the UK and USA, etc. One of the main Torts having a bearing on the right of all pedestrians is ‘negligence’. In the Judgment of Poonam Verma v. Ashwin Patel and other,[^237] the Supreme Court defined the contours of negligence in the following words “Negligence as a tort is the breach of a duty caused by omission to do something which a reasonable man would do, or doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do.

The definition involves the following constituents:

(1) a legal duty to exercise due care;

(2) breach of the duty; and

(3) consequential damages.

The breach of duty may be occasioned either by not doing something which a reasonable man, under a given set of circumstances would do, or, by doing some act which a reasonable prudent man would not do.”

The court also identified the manifestations of negligence “Negligence has many manifestations — it may be active negligence, collateral negligence, comparative negligence, concurrent negligence, continued negligence, criminal negligence, gross negligence, hazardous negligence, active and passive negligence, wilful or reckless negligence or negligence per se……”[^238] To prove negligence in a suit filed by pedestrians or street users as a claimant for the recovery of damages caused due to injury, loss or harm, the above-mentioned three constituents of the tort of negligence have to be established. Generally, in India, the Tort of negligence comes into play involving the relationship between the doctors and patients, and outside this sphere, its occurrence is very rare.

#### **C1.1.1 _Description and Examples_**

##### **C1.1.1.1 _Duty to Care_**

The term ‘duty’ refers to legal duty rather than moral or social duty. The Plaintiff has to prove that the Defendant owed to him ‘duty’ to care to be successful in getting damages from the court. Such duty is imposed by common law in general and not by contract between parties or by a statute. In India Courts heavily rely on principles of foreseeability and proximity laid down in the judgment of Donoghue v. Stevenson[^239] by the House of Lords, in determining the question of ‘existence of duty to care’ between the Plaintiff and the Defendant. While performing any act or omission if the defendant could reasonably foresee injury to the plaintiff and such injury is the direct result of the act or omission on the part of the defendant, then in such case there exists a duty to care. Since the duty to care and its existence is relational to situation and circumstance it is now a well-accepted principle in Tort law that new duty situations can be recognized from time to time, considering the socio, economic and political considerations. On this point to it is relevant to quote Lord Macmillan from the case of Donoghue v. Stevenson, “the conception of legal responsibility may develop in adaptation to altering social conditions and standards. The criterion of judgment must adjust and adapt itself to the changing circumstances of life. The categories of negligence are never closed”.

In light of this, it may be argued that providing accessible and obstruction-free streets, accessible means of transport, can be recognized by the courts as a part and parcel of duty to care and failure on the part of authorities in providing the same may lead to a breach of duty to care towards pedestrians generally and PWDs or older people, in particular, causing damages and the same may be vindicated in courts by claiming compensation by the victim. Unlike airports where personal assistance provided on demand to elderly and PWDs, Delhi Metro Rail does not have any such facility. There is often a gap between tactile strip and the platform and there is no barrier. There are reports at least two serious accidents of two blind females falling on the railway tracks and receiving serious injuries.[^240] Cases discussed in Section 4.2 Transport may be referred. The duty to care is illustrate by the following pronouncement of Delhi High Court. The unfortunate instance resulting in the death of a person while driving by falling into a pit due to insufficient street light at night is furnished by the decision of Delhi High Court. In this case of Criminal Justice Society v. Union of India[^241] the corporation tried to shift the blame of negligence on the contractor but the court did not entertain the same and held the corporation liable for the negligence vicariously and awarded compensation of INR 5,00,000/- to the representative of the deceased. While articulating the liability of the corporation the court observed “The Municipal Corporation of Delhi cannot afford to enter into contract of this nature and leave the citizens to their fate. It has the statutory obligation and, therefore, a sacred duty to see that such kinds of accidents are not caused due to negligence of a contractor. Hence, we direct the Commissioner MCD to constitute a task force which would be responsible to see that the contractors carry out the safety measures to the optimum level, so that no hazard is caused to any person and it would be easy on the part of the MCD to fix the responsibility on its task force rather than entering into an unnecessary labyrinth.”[^242]

##### **C1.1.1.2 _Breach of Duty_**

The existence of a duty is not enough for a successful claim in the tort of negligence. The Plaintiff has to prove that the same is breached by the Defendant. The breach of duty to care means non-observance of due care required in a particular situation by the Defendant. The standard of care required is that of a reasonable man’s standard in a given situation. If the Defendant has acted like any other reasonable man would have acted in a similar situation, then there is no negligence. The ‘reasonable man’s’ standard of care is an objective parameter to assess the question of breach of duty. It means it will not differ from individual to individual but certainly changes according to circumstances. Such degree of care also depends upon the obviousness of the risk. To put it by way of an example, it may be said that the authorities and individuals owe a higher degree of care towards old or disabled pedestrians, as the obviousness of the risk during walking or using streets to them is higher than in cases of other pedestrians. Therefore, the standard of care towards such persons would obviously be of a higher degree and may constitute breach easily in the present ableist policy standards and designs of streets. In respect of professional negligence, the Indian courts relies on the principles laid down in Bolam v. Friern Hospital Management Committee[^243] and have extended the same to negligence by professionals generally and not necessarily confined to doctors.[^244] In scenarios like negligence by professionals, the reasonable man’s standard of care rule may not apply[^245] viz. if a person is skilled or expert in the given business or work, then he is expected to exhibit a similar standard of care and skill, which any other expert in the given field would have exhibited.[^246] In the case of Raja Basha v. District Collector[^247] death of a person as result of electrocution due poor maintenance of wiring of street has resulted in award of compensation of INR 15,97,000/- on the ground of Negligence by Corporation and Tamil Nadu Electricity Board. The court while granting the compensation observed “It goes without saying that due to irregular maintenance of the electric wires by the respondents 2 and 3, the death of the deceased was happened.”[^248]

##### **C1.1.1.3 _Causation_**

Though an act of negligence is very close to a careless act or carelessness, not every careless act constitutes the tort of negligence. After the Plaintiff proves that there exists a duty to care and the same is breached by the Defendant, he needs to prove that such breach resulted in a loss, damage, or harm to him. If such causal connection is missing the Plaintiff will not succeed in his claim. In other words, ‘causation’ is a link between the Plaintiff’s loss and act or omission on the part of the Defendant. While answering the question if the harm caused to the Defendant is the direct result of Plaintiff’s wrongful action or not, the court applies the ‘but for’ test. The said test is understood in two senses, firstly it means that the loss/harm would not have been caused ‘but for’ the wrongful act of the Defendant. If the harm caused was not possible ‘but for’ the wrongful act, then the court would conclude that there is a direct relation between act and harm/loss. In the second sense, it means Defendant’s act is not responsible for the harm/loss caused, if the same loss/harm would have happened, despite wrongful act or not. In other words, if the harm/loss was bound to happen then, the act of Defendant is not a cause for the loss/harm. It is also possible that multiple factors are responsible for the damage caused, in such cases the Defendant is held liable if his actions caused or materially contributed to the damage. However, it is the duty of the Plaintiff to prove that the Defendant’s negligence is the main cause and materially contributed to the loss caused, among all other factors. While the principle of causation discusses the link between the wrongful act and loss/ harm as a consequence of such act, the principle of remoteness helps in determining whether such consequences are too remote or not? Any damage/harm that is too remote will not qualify for an award of damages. The test to identify what is remote harm is complex and may depend on a case-to-case basis. In this regard, there are two views. According to one view, all that is a ‘direct’ consequence of wrongful act can be considered as not remote and damages for such consequences can be recovered. The other view suggests that consequences are not too remote when they are foreseeable by a reasonable man and if they are foreseeable then he is liable for all loss/harm caused as a result of such actions.

While discussing the principle of causation and remoteness, a reference must also be made to ‘_novus actus intervenien’_ which means a new intervening act. The principle lays down that if any new and independent event that occurs after the wrongful action of the Defendant ends, contributing to or causing damage suffered by the Plaintiff, then such even puts an end to causation between wrongful act and damage caused. In such cases, the damages caused would be considered as too remote and Defendant will not be held liable for the same. The intervening act can be that of the Plaintiff herself or the third party. While determining the liability of the Defendant, he cannot waive his liability by contending that the Plaintiff would not have suffered or would have suffered less injury if he had not unusually thinned skull or unusually weak heart. [^249] In short, this principle lays down, that you must take your claimant as you find them and their vulnerability or weakness can be no ground to escape your liability. It is interesting to see that the impact of this principle that is, the response of the victim/plaintiff to the wrongful act of the Defendant is not judged by the objective standards of reasonable man’s test. To put in other words, the liability of the Defendant does not extinguish based on how in a similar situation a reasonable man would have reacted or degree of the harm he would have suffered from. This principle may be extended and be helpful to vindicate the rights of PWDs or older people who owing to their special characteristics are more vulnerable to injuries and their claims cannot be refuted on the ground of them being excessively weak or prone to injuries.

**Defence** – Since lack of reasonable care on the part of Defendant is an essential constituent of the tort of negligence, proof of exercise of the required amount of care on part of the Defendant towards the Plaintiff is a complete defense to the litigation in negligence. Hence defenses like the Act of God or inevitable accidents would indirectly apply if the Defendant could establish that despite the exercise of reasonable care the loss or injury is caused. However, defenses like Act of God or inevitable accidents would not apply if failure to take reasonable care is present alongside such defenses. Although the law of negligence in India is almost a replica of the common law of Tort, it is subject to an important exception that in case of a clash between fundamental right and common law, the former will prevail. It is plausible to argue that voluntary submission to injury beyond the circumstances of medical treatment may amount to a waiver of the right to life, whereas a waiver of the right to life is impermissible. Additionally, the partial defense of contributory negligence is also recognized in India. While raising such defense the Defendant needs to establish that the Plaintiff himself/herself also contributed to the injury, harm, or loss caused due to any act or omission on his/her part.

#### **C1.1.2 _Remedies, Sanctions, or Other Outcomes_**

The term ‘damage’ refers to an injury, loss or harms to the legal right of a person. On the other hand, the term ‘damages’ is equivalent to the monetary compensation granted by the court for breach of one’s legal right. The most common remedy under Tort law is compensatory damages. The approach of tort law is ‘victim’ centric and therefore it aims at reinstating the Plaintiff in the original position as if the loss/harm was not caused by granting damages to compensate. In this connection too, it is important to note that India has not recognized compensation as an efficacious remedy for violation of civil rights. And to this effect, it has entered a reservation to the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights.[^250]

Of late, compensation has been recognized as a public law remedy. The damages to be awarded through such remedy have to be merely nominal and not aggravated.[^251] Damages can be of four types a) Contemptuous damages are awarded when the Plaintiff has technically legal claim but there is no moral justification for it, court grant a half penny showing its disapproval of the conduct of the Plaintiff. b) Nominal Damages are awarded where the purpose of an action is only to establish a right, no substantial harm is caused. c) Ordinary or compensatory damages are awarded where it is necessary to compensate. Under this type, the number of damages fairly matches with the actual loss caused. d) Exemplary damages are not compensatory but they aim at punishing the defendant and deter him from similar actions in the future. However, exemplary damages are not awarded by courts routinely in cases of negligence. The Supreme Court of India has recognized certain situations in which the exemplary damages may be granted viz. oppressive, unconstitutional behaviour of the Government, its servants or statutory authorities; or in cases where harm or injury results from hazardous or inherently dangerous nature of the activity carried out by the Defendant.[^252] In India, remedies against fatal accidents are still governed by a pre-colonial law, i.e., the Fatal Accidents Act, 1855[^253]. The main objective of this Act is to provide compensation to families for loss occasioned by the death of a person caused by actionable wrong. This Act is in force throughout India. Although the Act does not define Fatal Accident, its application is contingent on the death of a party as a consequence of a wrongful act, neglect, or default resulting in death. In other words, all other injuries suffered by a person as a consequence of the wrongful act, neglect, or default are beyond the scope of this legislation.

It follows that the remedy provided under this Act is more in the nature of providing compensation to the family of the deceased as a result of loss of the breadwinner rather than a redressal of a wrong or injury caused against the concerned individual. Section 1-A provides the right and procedure to initiate the claim for damages as a consequence of a fatal accident. It reads “Whenever the death of a person shall be caused by wrongful act, neglect or default, and the act, neglect or default is such as would (if death had not ensured) have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof, the party who would have been liable if death had not ensued shall be liable to an action or suit for damages, notwithstanding the death of the person injured, and although the death shall have been caused under such circumstances as the amount in law to a felony or other crime. Every such action or suit shall be for the benefit of the wife, husband, parent, and child, if any, of the person whose death shall have been so caused, and shall be brought by and in the name of the executor, administrator, or representative of the person deceased; and in every such action the Court may give such damages as it may think proportioned to the loss resulting from such death to the parties respectively, for whom and for whose benefit such action shall be brought; and the amount so recovered, after deducting all costs and expenses, including the costs not recovered from the defendant, shall be divided amongst the before-mentioned parties, or any of them, such shares as the Court by its judgment or decree shall direct”. Inter alia, this section creates an exception against the operation of a maxim in the law of Tort ‘_actio personalis moritur cum persona’_ which means that a personal right of action dies with the person. In other words, due to the operation of this Act a legal fiction is created in favour of a person who died as a result of fatal accident, and on his behalf the Legal Heirs are empowered to maintain the suit for recovery of compensation. Another feature of this section is to leave at the discretion of the court to determine the measure of damages by the use of the term ‘proportioned to the loss resulting from the death of a person’.

Unlike the Common law of negligence where aggravated damages are not possible to be awarded, in light of the principle of ‘reasonable care and reasonable duty and reasonable man,’ the language of the Fatal Accident Act appears to be open-ended even to cover the cases of aggravated damages in light of personal circumstances and conditions of a plaintiff. However, it will be doubtful that the notion of aggravated damages would cover aggravation in injuries as a result of the perpetuation of ableist design i.e., non-conformity to accessibility and universal design standards. It is, therefore, to speculate whether pedestrians with a disability can make effective use of this Act.[^254] Interestingly the law enables the executor administrator or representative of the deceased to insert a claim for and recover any pecuniary loss to the estate of the deceased occasioned by such wrongful act, neglect, or default.[^255] It is also made clear by this Act that the word person has to be interpreted broadly to include natural and artificial persons for bringing claims. Discussion of this Act is important, as it provides for useful redressal to cover compensation on behalf of pedestrians who died as a result of fatal accidents while on the road.

Unlike statutory law, under the law of Tort, there is no fixed formula to measure the amount of compensation, the same depends upon a variety of factors like causes, facts, and circumstances of the case. While measuring the damages for wrongful action, the court may consider pecuniary loss (actual pecuniary loss, probable future loss of income by reason of incapacity) and non-pecuniary loss (i.e., personal pain and suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life) caused to the Plaintiff. The idea of pain and suffering is not limited to physical pain but also includes mental agony. The duration and severity of such pain and suffering are important factors that are taken into consideration by the court. However, in respect of personal pain and suffering, if the victim becomes wholly unconscious or otherwise cannot experience the pain, no damages under this head can be granted. The idea that the damages for pain and suffering should not be awarded in case the Plaintiff is not aware of the same i.e., when unconscious or when in a coma is deeply problematic because awareness can be measured only in terms of personal perception of the Plaintiff. It fails to take an account of bodily perception and the perception of the caregivers and thereby not recognizing the interdependent model of a human. This is very aptly depicted in a movie where a doctor perceives a body of a person worthy of experimentation as a ‘medical subject’, whereas another person looks at the person in a coma in terms of his alienation and isolation and in a bid to start the interaction with him often engages a dialogue with him. The audience is made to believe how such a dialogue results in positive gestures by the so-called ‘medical subject’.

It is also necessary to shed light on the notion of reasonableness qua negligence. How far it is appropriate to achieve the same threshold of ‘reasonableness’ in case of claims by or brought against pedestrians suffering from disabilities, when the default is completely in favour of non-disabled, does it not amount to indirect discrimination? In respect of defense of illegality, it not possible to argue that by not creating rights enabling conditions and by not eliminating the rights disabling conditions qua PWDs the legal order thereby don’t perpetuate ableist design and law? It is like _fait accompli_ where although the right is created and recognized it is saddled by unconstitutional conditions. It has been held in Rajasthan State Road Transport v. Smt. Kistoori Devi[^256] that Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 being benevolent legislation and broader in mandate and special in nature will give way to Fatal Accidents Act 1855 in case of any conflict.

#### **C1.1.3 _Enforcement_**

In India, the Law of Limitation is very peculiar in respect of Tort Litigation. Part VII of the Limitation Act, 1963 deals with suits relating to Tort. Article 72 lays down a time period of one year from the date of wrongful act or omission. It states that suits can be filed “for compensation for doing or for omitting to do an act alleged to be in pursuance of any enactment in force for the time being in the territories to which this Act extends.”[^257] From the language of Article 72, it refers to act or omission in pursuance of an enactment. Whereas when we talk about the Law of Torts, it is in the realm of common and uncodified law. It is, therefore, possible to argue that in absence of any specific provision in the Act in respect of suits for compensation against negligence, general provision of the Limitation Act in Art 137 is applicable. It lays down a period of 3 years from the date of right to apply accrues. It is not clear whether the word application used in Article 137 includes in its scope ‘suit’ or ‘plaint’. As regards claims by the executors, administrators, and representatives under the Fatal Accident Act are concerned, the Limitation Act, 1963, Article 82 provides for two years period from the date of death of the person. Although the costs of litigation have to be borne by the Plaintiff/Pedestrian, if he is unable to pay, he has to apply being indigent under the relevant provisions of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908\. The court may recognize a person as indigent subject to a number of conditions suffice here to say that the person and his property must be within the cap prescribed by law to attend to the status of indigent. At any rate, the indigency status removes the hurdle in the way of institution of a suit and after the conclusion of suit the power is given to the Provincial Government to recover the court fees from either of the party to the litigation as ordered by the Court.[^258] At the provincial level, the Court Fees are prescribed under the Court Fees Act of respective provinces, e.g., in the province of Maharashtra the said law is known as Maharashtra Court Fees Act, 1959[^259]. To file a writ petition in the Supreme Court, a nominal fee is to be paid as per the Rules of Supreme Court, 2013.[^260] In respect of Public Interest Litigation in certain cases, the Supreme Court may require the party to deposit some amount in the court as a condition for filing the petition.

### **C1.2 Breach of Statutory Duty**

#### **C1.2.1 _Description and Examples_**

In India, in addition to the common law principle of ‘negligence’, the legal system also has certain enactments that can be invoked by the pedestrians or road users against negligent actions of individuals or public authorities. In fact, in India, the common law notion of negligence can be said to be residuary in light of its codification under the Indian Penal Code, 1860.[^261]

Besides, there are statutes like the Easement Act, 1882 which also creates duties in individuals in respect of certain rights like the right to way, etc. Particularly, this assumes importance in the rural area. Although we do not have any detailed legislation regulating the rights of pedestrians on highways, nevertheless while inviting tenders from contractors, the government authorities seek compliance with the measures affecting the rights of the pedestrians. In respect of statutory duties particularly in the context of welfare legislation, it is important to point out that the threshold for observance of these duties is very high and subject to a number of conditions like the allocation of resources, timeline, initiation of program schemes and policies, etc. It is, therefore, not possible to equate the nature of these duties or to collapse the same into the duty of care which is very specific and even the prima facie finding of negligence is enough for its trigger. At any rate, in India, there is almost a lack of culture to equate statutory duties with that of duty of care as understood in the law of torts.

#### **C1.2.2 _Remedies, Sanctions or, Other Outcomes_**

    See discussion above C1.1 (b)

#### **C1.2.3 _Enforcement_**

In our opinion, it is also possible to compliment the writ jurisdiction of Supreme Court and High Court discussed below in section D1.1 (b) exploring the route of civil courts by invoking Section 39 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 which reads “When, to prevent the breach of an obligation, it is necessary to compel the performance of certain acts which the Court is capable of enforcing, the Court may in its discretion grant an injunction to prevent the breach complained of, and also to compel performance of the requisite acts.” It is also possible to argue that to give teeth to the provisions of this law, it must be read in light of Harmonised Guidelines and Space Standards for Barrier-Free Built Environment for Persons with Disabilities and Elderly Persons. See discussion above C 1.1 (c).

## **C2 Obstructing roads or pavements**

### **C2.1 Common Law Negligence**

#### **C2.1.1 _Description and Examples_**

The common law tort of negligence, already explained above (C1.1), could be used where a local authority creates danger by obstructing a road, which results in injury, harm, or loss. Non-fulfillment of its obligation under the RPWD Act, 2016 in respect of accessible roads and streets can be redressed both in the Supreme Court and High Courts as well as in a civil court under Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution, and Section 39 of Specific Relief Act, 1963 respectively. Even the offices of State Commissioner and Chief Commissioner of PWDs can be moved and intervention of Commissioner Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, 1949 may also be sought. To illustrate the actions brought by pedestrians to recover damages against municipal corporation on account of tree fall, we discuss here two interesting cases.

1\. Rajkot Municipal Corporation v. Manjuleben Jayantilal Nakum and Ors.[^262] This case involves the death of a person who was walking on the footpath on the way to his office when a road-side tree suddenly fell on him which led to his death. The suit for damages was filed by his legal representative to claim compensation for his death, and they succeeded in the High Court on the ground of breach of duty of care by the corporation. However, the Supreme Court overturned the judgment of the Bombay High Court by attaching significance to the notions of proximity, foreseeability, and causation. It was held that the corporation was not under such a duty for maintenance of roadside trees to protect them from falling and injuring a passerby that a breach thereof gives rise to a common law action for negligence, although the corporation may in its discretion under Section 69 of the Bombay Provincial Municipal Corporation Act, 1949 provide from time to time for the planting and maintenance of trees of roadside and elsewhere. The court observed that having regard to the provisions of the Act and the conditions prevailing in the country, it would not be just and proper to hold that the corporation was under a duty to keep constant vigil by testing the healthy condition of the trees in the public places frequently by a passerby and that it was liable for omission thereof in negligence to a passerby who got injured by falling of a tree. [^263] Court distinguished the facts of the instant case with hypothetical examples to crystalize its conclusions viz “where a hanging branch of a tree/tree is gradually falling on the ground. The statutory/local authority fails to take timely action to have it cut and removed and one of the passers-by dies when the branch/tree falls on him. Though the injured or the deceased has contributed to the negligence for the injury or death, the local authority, etc. is equally liable for its negligence/omission in the performance of the duty because the proximity is anticipated. Suppose a boy not suspecting the danger climbs or reaches the falling tree and gets hurt, the defendant would be liable for tort of negligent. The defect is apparent. Negligence is obvious, proximity and neighborhood anticipated and lack of duty of care stands established.”[^264]

In a very telling passage, the Court emphasized on proximity in respect of causation by observing “There would be no special relationship between the statutory authority and the plaintiff who is a remote user of the foot-path or the street by the side of which the trees were planted, unless the defendant is aware of the condition of the tree that it is likely to fall on the footpath on which the plaintiff/class of persons to which he belongs frequents it. The defendant by his non-feasance is not responsible for the accident or cause of the death since admittedly there was no visible sign that the tree was affected by the deceased. It had fallen in a still condition of weather.”[^265] In facts similar to the hypothetical example seen above when a person died by falling off a dead tree which apparently did not show any signs of life, it was not difficult for the Supreme Court to find the corporation liable for payment of compensation.[^266] It is submitted that the law of tortious liability in respect of state or corporation in India appears to be in a state of comatose by equating its liability with that of erstwhile East India Company. When in England the defense of ‘King can do no wrong’ has vanished, how can India carry on its legacy of transformative constitutionalism alongside a regressive tortious liability provision of Article 300 of Constitution of India, is a moot question. Moreover, to confine the liability of corporations to patent defects is to probably equate it with the liability of private individuals. A corporation as a public body is expected to be vigilant and proactive in its initiatives and actions, to minimize and even mitigate the harms caused to the public, at large. In terms of the colonial notion of causation, the relationship between the general public and the corporation would be proximate only in most rare cases, but that should not make the corporation any less liable in terms of performance of its public duties. Of course, there may be different yardsticks to determine the quantum of compensation.

Last but not least, the notion of negligence and duty of care in order to cover the harms caused to PWDs or older people has to go beyond the ableist considerations. To illustrate this proposition, we may examine the following case of Union of India through General Manager, Central Railway, Mumbai v. Vijay Pandurang Patil. [^267] In India, it is not uncommon for blind people to use running trains as the place of business to make a living. In Pune region itself, many blind persons sell small toys, paper soaps, and other products of daily usage in running trains. There are many instances where these vendors have suffered injuries while catching trains or while deboarding the trains mainly because of inaccessible platforms. A comprehensive manual on accessibility and to formulate the policy based on the same is required.

### **C2.2 Breach of Statutory Duty**

#### **C2.2.1 _Description and Examples_**

The Easementary rights in India are exercised by the Dominant owner over the servient owner in servient heritage. The Indian Easement Act 1882 defines these terms as follows “The land for the beneficial enjoyment of which the right exists is called the dominant heritage, and the owner or occupier thereof the dominant owner; the land on which the liability is imposed is called the servient heritage, and the owner or occupier thereof the servient owner.”[^268] A close reading of the Act demonstrates that for the beneficial enjoyment of one’s property, the dominant owner has a right over the servient heritage without disturbance, and the servient owner is under a duty not to obstruct the said right of the former. In case of a breach of the duty, the Act has a provision for filing a suit for compensation and prohibitive injunction, a remedy which can be by exercised by the dominant owner.[^269] Under the Act, even the licensee has the right to have the property under license to be safe, and the grantor of the license is under the duty to abstain from doing anything rendering the property dangerous to the person or property of the licensee.[^270]

The provisions of the Indian Easement Act, 1882 are relevant for two reasons: a) many premises or land dedicated to public use are in the hands of the private parties, b) even on public property and land easementary right can be exercised. In the context of pedestrians, the right to way without any obstruction or disturbance is the simplest example. Since we do not have an evolved Tort law culture to recover compensation by filing individual suits, the Parliament of India has innovated with the enactment of no-fault liability legislation like the Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991[^271] and the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988[^272] to mandate the payment of nominal compensation. To put the other way round, after an accident to provide some kind of fall back, the liability is imposed on the Defendant to pay nominal damages without going through the adversarial process. We can say that it is mid-way between public and private reparation. Besides, we have already referred to other relevant provisions in Part B 1.1 (a).

## **C2.3 Public nuisance**

### **C2.3.1 Description and Examples**

Nuisance is of two types – private and public nuisance. Under the Indian legal system, Private nuisance is a tort and public nuisance gives rise to criminal action. The discussion as regards private nuisance is not relevant here as it deals with injuries affecting one’s property or affecting its enjoyment by interfering materially with one’s health, comfort, or convenience. Public nuisance does not give rise to any personal cause of action, under the law of Tort. However, an individual may initiate an action in respect of public nuisance if the following factors are present;

1. The person must show that he has suffered an injury or loss beyond what is suffered by the rest of the public;

2. Such injury is direct and not mere consequential;

3. The injury is of substantial character.

### **C2.3.2 Remedies, Sanctions, or Other Outcomes**

See the discussion in Section C 2.3 (c).

### **C2.3.3 Enforcement**

The Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, Section 91 provides for filing of the civil suit for Public nuisances and other wrongful acts affecting the public. It reads “(1) in the case of a public nuisance or other wrongful act affecting, or likely to affect, the public, a suit for a declaration and injunction or for such other relief as may be appropriate in the circumstances of the case, may be instituted, \-(a) by the Advocate General, or (b) with the leave of the Court, by two or more persons, even though no special damage has been caused to such persons by reason of such public nuisance or other wrongful act. (2) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any right of suit which may exist independently of its provisions.” The section empowers the Advocate General to initiate the action for public nuisance. Further, the section enables the filing of a civil suit with the permission of the court relaxing the requirement of the existence of special damages. In respect of the discussion on the issue of limitation under Common Law Negligence, see C1.1 (c) Enforcement.

## **C3 Inaccessible or unsafe design of streets or street features**

### **C3.1 Common Law Negligence**

#### **C3.1.1 _Description and Examples_**

The tort of common law negligence explained above (see C1.1) is applicable to the issue of inaccessible or unsafe design of street or street feature. In another case, the Gujrat High Court[^273] highlighted the deteriorating conditions of the speed breakers emphasizing how speeds breakers in bad shape may result in deadly accidents. The court recognized the responsibility of the Municipal Corporation to review the condition of all the speed breakers and issued the following directions, “We, therefore, direct the Registry to forthwith forward a copy of this judgment to the State Government. The State Government shall, within a period of six months from the date of receipt of the copy of this order, do the needful in the matter, so as to incorporate a proper provision for regulating the speed including signboard and markings on the speed breakers and/or artificially made rough road. We may observe that Section 138 of the Motor Vehicle Act 1988 empowered the State Government to make rules for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions contained in Chapter VIII of the Act. Looking to various sections in Chapter VIII, it is very clear that the State is empowered to erect traffic signs, as provided in Section 116 of the Act. Looking to the entire Chapter, it appears that safety measures are provided, and, therefore, it is incumbent on the State to make Rules in this behalf to carry out traffic regulations.”[^274]

The death of persons as a result of collapsing of old Clock Tower on them in a crowded street has led the Supreme Court in the case of Municipal Corporation of Delhi v Subhagwanti & Others**[^275]** to hold the Municipal Corporation of Delhi liable for negligence. While invoking the principle of ‘Res ipsa loquitur,’ the court also awarded compensation to the legal representative of the deceased. For fixing the compensation, the court used its own discretion, taking into account the different profiles of the deceased. Rejecting the contention of the Corporation that the defects in the tower being latent it cannot be held liable for negligence, the court observed “It is admitted, in this case, that the Clock Tower was built about 80 years ago and the evidence of the Chief Engineer is that the safe time-limit of existence of the building which collapsed was 40 or 45 years. In view of the fact that the building had passed its normal age at which the mortar could be expected to deteriorate it was the duty of the appellant to carry out careful and periodical inspection for the purpose of determining whether, in fact, deterioration had taken placed whether any precautions were necessary to strengthen the building.”[^276] To our knowledge, there is hardly any tort case law dealing with PWDs specifically. The principal reason is that what is perceived to be obstruction by the disabled or older people may not either have public value or maybe neglected or deprioritized under the influence of ableist ideology. A case law, therefore, is mainly available in respect of breach of statutory duty.

### **C4.1 Common Law Negligence and Breach of Statutory Duty**

#### **C4.1.1 _Description and Examples_**

In India, the common law of negligence is not very effective in curbing injuries to the pedestrians, rather the criminal law generally comes into play. Besides, in the absence of Tort law culture, the damages can also be availed by injured parties under the rubric of the no-fault liability under the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 and the Fatal Accident Act,1855. See discussion C 1.1 (b) and D 4.1 (a). Mostly in India, Motor vehicles are insured with respect to third-party injuries during accidents. The above discussion is illustrated with the following judicial pronouncement. Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation Ltd., Villupuram v. Papa and Ors.[^277] involved a road accident of a blind person as a result of his collision with the State-owned bus resulting in his death. While the deceased was standing on the road, a bus belonging to the Provincial Transport Corporation driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner, dashed against the deceased, and as a result, the deceased fell on the road and he sustained grievous injuries all over his body and he died while he was on the way to the hospital. The legal representatives of the deceased filed the claim petition claiming a sum of Rs. 5,00,000/- as compensation before Motor Accident Claim Tribunal under Motor Vehicle Act, 1988\. On perusal of evidence the Tribunal Rs. 3,76,400/- with interest at 7.5% per annum as compensation. On appeal, the corporation contested the decision of the Tribunal by arguing that while attempting to get into the bus, the deceased lost his control, for, other passengers, who were standing outside the bus, have also attempted to get into the bus and thereby he fell in front of the front tire. It was further argued that the Tribunal, without looking into this aspect, has wrongly fixed the negligence only on the driver of the bus belonging to the transport corporation. Rejecting the aforementioned argument in absence of evidence, the High Court of Madras upheld the decision of the Tribunal on compensation. This case is a glaring example of apathy on part of both the Corporation and the High Court because both the institutions looked at the incidence as a discreet event rather than looking at it from the broader frame of inaccessibility.

#### **C4.1.2 _Remedies, Sanctions or Other Outcomes_**

The remedies in India are mainly by way of fine or imprisonment to the driver guilty of rash or negligent driving, which is a state-initiated action. In case of compensation under no-fault liability is fixed under the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 or the Fatal Accident Act. See discussion in C 1.1 (b) and D 4.1 (a). Recovery of compensation against insurance companies for third party injuries, cases under this rubric involve disputes pertaining quantum of compensation. In India, rash driving is more a civic issue than involving horizontal relations, and is predominantly state-regulated by government authorities, e.g., installing jammers in vehicles to prevent over-speeding beyond the prescribed limit. By using speed guns, the drivers over speeding are fined and even their license can be suspended.

#### **C4.1.3 _Enforcement_**

In respect of discussion on enforcement and issue of limitation see C1.1 (c) Enforcement. There is a limitation period of six months under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 to move claims for compensation.

## **C6 Noteworthy Project-Related Observations and Concerns**

The notion of judicial minimalism certainly influences the degree of enforcement by the Court. The limited resources compound the same. In India, compensation is not perceived as an efficacious remedy for breach of civil rights. The local authorities are not expected to be held liable for a breach of statutory duties by way of compensatory reliefs. The emphasis on the other hand is on corrective measures and fixing accountability of the authorities by way of sensor and allied actions. Particularly, the gap between enforcement and a breach of statutory duties qua PWDs produce undesirable outcomes. Resort to the writ jurisdiction of High Courts and the Supreme Court also does not produce predictable results. Moreover, it is expensive and time-consuming. Practically, the Supreme Court or High Courts may find it extremely difficult to track the follow-up actions as a result of their judgments. For example, it is not easy to find out at what stage a petition filed in the Court in respect of making railway accessible has reached. Sometimes, due to the difference of opinion between High Court and the Supreme Court, petitions may prove to be ineffective. Thus, in Nipun Malhotra v. Government of NCT, Delhi case (discussed above in A 4.2) the Delhi High Court provided a salutary relief but when the matter went in appeal, the Supreme Court gave a cold shoulder to the demands of the petitioner, probably owing to a lack of expertise and sensitivity.

Additionally, in India, mostly the causes of pedestrians with protected characteristics can reach courts only if there is an active NGO or Disability Persons Organisations, and therefore, the cases brought by such individuals in their personal capacity are few and far between. In light of the dominance of ableist design and very recent origins of the evolution of the principle of accessibility in India, unsafe street or street features simpliciter may not have sufficient legal purchase to raise tort claims. However, unsafe street design coupled with additional claims like negligence may be effective in recovering compensation as demonstrated by the survey of cases. To put the point more preciously, if the Government has taken accessibility initiatives but if the same does not fully conform with the standards prescribed by the experts, the courts are still likely to be deferential. But on the other hand, along with the same if the element of negligence is also proved, the chances of success are more. Upon loud thinking, we are of the opinion that a court shows the willingness to tie the issue of unsafe street design or feature with the fundamental right to move freely throughout India guaranteed under Article 19 (1)(g) of the Constitution of India, 1950, alongside the ideals of constitutional morality and transformative constitutionalism, then, there is a possibility of making out a case of public duty in the government in light of the aforementioned two ideals. We are encouraged to take this position in light of the curial invocation of these ideals to challenge the hegemony of heterosexuality _pari Passu_, the hegemony of ableism may also be problematized.

Although collision between the drivers, scooters and pedestrians are fact specific, in terms of the outcome of cases, comparatively, the drivers being under strict the vigil of law and pedestrians being merely mandated to be careful and circumspect in their road conduct, save as the establishment of defense of contributory negligence against later, the courts are likely to hold the former liable. However, in India, there is also a cushion of no-fault liability particularly against the truck and car drivers. In absence of percolation of disability rights jurisprudence, the general remedial laws are bound to be blunt in producing desirable results.

# **D. Laws that can be used by public bodies to challenge problems for pedestrians generally**

In absence of specific equality duty against the public sector, the legal actions by public bodies are bound to be few and far between. At any rate, in India, public bodies like the National Human Rights Commission, the Chief Commissioner for Persons with disabilities, the National Commissioner for women and their state Counterparts, the Commission for Scheduled caste and Scheduled Tribes, etc. have a recommendatory role and at the most, they can move the courts on behalf of their respective constituencies against the government for seeking compliance with laws or have a redressal against non-compliance. However, in light of the available trends, it is most unlikely that the public bodies would confront the government. On the other hand, what has been mostly observed is the tendency of these bodies to pursue the government. However, certain NGOs or Disabled Persons Organisation have used public interest litigations to vindicate the group rights of the subjects associated with our project. The cases dealing with Public Interest litigations are already discussed in the report. See specifically A4.2 and B1(a).

## **D1 Failing to safeguard pedestrians from holes, roadworks, traffic flow, and other hazards**

### **D1.1 Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act ,1949 and Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957**

#### **D1.1.1 _Description and Examples_**

The Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act,1949 has a dedicated chapter, i.e., chapter XIV on the Construction, Maintenance and Improvement of Streets. The term ‘street’ and ‘public street’ are defined under this Act in Sections 2 (52) and (63) and read,

Section 2 (52) “public street” means any street-(a) heretofore levelled, paved, metaled, channeled, sewered or repaired out of municipal or other public fund, or (b) which under the provisions of Section 224 is declared to be, or under any other provision of this Act becomes, a public street;

Section 2 (63) “street” includes any highway, and any causeway, bridge, viaduct, arch, road, lane, footway, sub-way, court, alley or riding path or passage, whether a thoroughfare or not, over which the public have a rite of passage or access or have passed and had access uninterruptedly for a period of twenty years, and when there is a footway as well as a carriage way in any street, the said term, includes both. Besides, Section 63 of the Act is also vital in rolling out sanitation obligations pertaining to streets inter alia, “….to make reasonable and adequate provision, by any means or measures which it is lawfully competent to it to use or to take, for each of the following matters, namely —(2) the watering, scavenging and cleansing of all public streets and places in the City and the removal of all sweepings therefrom;

(7) the lighting of public streets, municipal markets and public buildings vested in the Corporation;

(9) the naming or numbering of streets and of public places vesting in the Corporation and the numbering of premises;

(18) the construction, maintenance, alteration and improvement of public streets, bridges, sub-ways, culverts, cause-ways and the like;

(7) the construction and maintenance in public streets or places of drinking fountains for human beings and water-troughs for animals”

Under Section 203 of the Act, the Commissioner has the obligation to cause “all public streets vested in the Corporation to be levelled, metaled or paved, channeled, altered and repaired, as occasion shall require, and may also from time to time widen, extend or otherwise improve any such street or cause the soil thereof to be raised, lowered or altered and may place and keep in repair fences and posts for the safety of pedestrians….”

Section 205(a) and (c) also empowers the Commissioner with the authorization from the Corporation, to layout and make a new public street and to construct bridges and sub-ways respectively. The Commissioner is obligated to inform herself with the standards of accessibility and universal design underlying Article 9 of the UNCRPD read with the relevant provision of the RPWD Act and Harmonised Guidelines and Space Standards for Barrier-Free Built Environment for Persons with Disabilities and Elderly Persons. (See Section A 1.4)

In this regard, Section 226 needs to be mentioned. The Sub-section (1) imposes obligation on any person, not “to erect, setup, add to, or place against or in front of any premises any structure or fixture, which will— (a) overhang, jut or project into, or in any way encroach upon, or obstruct in any way the safe or convenient passage of the public along, any street, or (b) jut or project into or encroach upon any drain or open channel in any street, so as in any way to interfere with the use or proper working of such drain or channel or to impede the inspection or cleansing thereof.” Section 226 (2) to (4) empowers the Commissioner to cause such obstructions to be removed to ensure proper use of the streets and other facilities by the public. This section recognizes the right of the pedestrians to walk and navigate free from obstruction.

In the famous case of Olga Tellis and Ors. v. Bombay Municipal Corporation Supreme Court has struck a balance between the right of the hawkers alongside the right of the pedestrians. Section 229 imposes duty on every person, not to erect or set-up any wall, fence, rail, post, step, booth or other structure whether fixed or movable and whether of a permanent or a temporary nature, or any fixture in or upon any street or any part of such street. Section 230 specific on seeking permission on part of any person causing obstruction in a Public Street below specified high by way of hanging any object etc. and completely prohibits placing or depositing upon any street any obstruction in form stall, chair, box, bench, etc. Section 231 empowers the Commissioner to without notice remove anything erected, deposited or hawked or exposed for sale in contravention of Act. Section 233 guards against unattended animals and has a sequester provision. There are also detailed provisions regarding the permissibility of temporary erections on the streets during festivals and precautions to be taken while the street is under repair or maintenance work. During such maintenance work, the Commissioner is obligated to close the traffic in such streets and if any damage is caused to street causes repair without delay.

Under Section 238, the Commissioner is under a duty to take the following precautions while the construction/repair work is in progress on the street, “(a) take proper precaution for guarding against accident by shoring up and protecting the adjoining buildings; (b) have any place where the soil or pavement has been opened or broken up, fenced and guarded; (c) have a light sufficient for the warning of passengers set up and kept every night against any such place and against any bars, chains or posts set up under Section 236 for so long as such place shall be continued open or broken up, or such bars, chains or posts shall remain set up.”

The section further mentions that no person without written permission from the Commissioner shall remove aforementioned precautions. Section 239 guards against littering the streets and prohibits every person from depositing building materials thereon and digging of the streets without permission. If such permissions are granted the person or authorities to take due precautions for Public Safety and reinstate the street without delay to the satisfaction of the Commissioner. There is also a provision to provide parking and halting lots by the Commissioner for vehicles, which she is obligated to execute in consultation with the Police Commissioner. She is also duty-bound to ensure that Sky signs and advertisement hoardings do not obstruct the navigation of pedestrians. The provisions of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 being almost similar in substance to the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, 1949 need not be repeated. The former law is relevant as Delhi is one of the cities to be sample city for the project.

#### **D1.1.2 _Remedies, Sanctions or Other Outcomes_**

A close look Appendix II read with Section 392 of The Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, 1949 providing the level of penalties shows that non-compliance with the aforementioned provisions is visited with petty fines. The remedies provided under the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 being similar in substance to the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, 1949 need not be repeated. Most of the duties seen above being public in nature are amenable to the writ of mandamus by High Courts and the Supreme Court under Articles 226 and 32 of Constitution of India, 1950, respectively. As a matter of fact, the Supreme Court has issued a very detailed direction in the case of _Ratlam Municipality v. Shri. Vardhichand_ [^278] dealing with maintenance of health, hygiene, and sanitary provisions and pari passu directions can be sought against any Municipal Commissioner of a Corporation under the writ jurisdiction of the courts mentioned above.

#### **D1.1.3 _Enforcement_**

The obligations under these The Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, 1949 and Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 are enforceable by Municipal Commissioners. Besides, NGOs may also move Public Interest Litigations.

## **D2 Inaccessible or unsafe design of streets or street features**

### **D2.1 Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966 (MRTP Act, 1966\)**

As a part of the MRTP Act, 1966, the provincial government of Maharashtra has announced ‘_The Special Township Policy’_ (2016) for Integrated Development. As a part of this policy, the private builders are allowed to construct big townships of an area on 100 acres of land or more. For the first 10 years after construction, the private builders are to look after infrastructure — internal roads, water supply, electricity distribution, and local transport after which its governance will be handed over to a civic body. To read in between the lines, it follows that the private builders are now under the obligation to cater accessibility and universal design to promote the inclusion of diverse sections of the community including PWDs to be a part of these townships.[^279] For this purpose, reliance may also be placed on the judgment of the Gauhati High Court in _Araman Ali’s_ Case (discussed in B 2.1 (B) wherein the court has applied the provisions of RPWD Act, 2016 in the context of facilities to be provided by the private sector.) The discussion of judgment is significant because it has broken a new ground of judicial review by perceiving a private gym as partaking characteristics of ‘public building’ and thereby enforcing non-discrimination on the ground of disability as a civil right and even as a basic human right. The Court has focused on the public functions of the body rather than its private constitution. The relevant provisions of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act,1949 and Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 discussed in C 2.2 (a) are also relevant and need not be repeated.

## **D3 Obstructing roads or pavements**

### **D3.1 Public Nuisance and Statutory Duties**

#### **D3.1.1 _Description and Examples_**

Public Nuisance is dealt with by Section 268 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, and is a part of the ‘public law’. The Section reads “A person is guilty of a public nuisance who does any act or is guilty of an illegal omission which causes any common injury, danger or annoyance to the public or to the people in general who dwell or occupy property in the vicinity, or which must necessarily cause injury, obstruction, danger or annoyance to persons who may have occasion to use any public right. A common nuisance is not excused on the ground that it causes some convenience or advantage.” [^280]

Public nuisance affects the public at large or considerable number of people, and is the subject of one action. Actions or omissions interfering with comfort, safety, health or causing annoyance by ways of noise, smell, fumes, etc. is considered a nuisance. Obstructing pavements or streets by placing objects is a good example of public nuisance as it causes common injury to the right of safe passage. Although we do not have any specific legislation to regulate an occupier’s liability in connection with the escape of any animal or hazardous substances, there are legislation regulations and tort obligations regulating the same, e.g., the Municipal Corporations have regulations of sequestering pet animals straying on the public streets. Another example is Section 11 of the Cattle Trespass Act, 1871\. It reads “Cattle damaging public roads, canals and embankments- Persons in charge of public roads, pleasure-grounds, plantations, canals, drainage-works, embankments and the like and officers of police, may seize or cause to be seized any cattle doing damage to such roads, grounds, plantations, canals, drainage-works, embankments and the like, or the sides or slopes of such roads, canals, drainage-works or embankments or found straying thereon, and shall send them or cause them to be sent within twenty-four hours to the nearest pound.”

#### **D3.1.2 _Remedies, Sanctions and Other Outcomes_**

As regards offence of Public Nuisance is concerned the following sections of Indian Penal Code, 1860 are relevant.

“290. Punishment for public nuisance in cases not otherwise provided for. —Whoever commits a public nuisance in any case not otherwise punishable by this Code, shall be punished with fine which may extend to two hundred rupees.” However, the punishment being very meager amount of fine may not prove to be effective. Another common remedy that can be sought is ‘injunction’, as acts causing nuisance are continuous, prohibiting the party causing nuisance is relevant. In cases where the omission leads to causing nuisance, a mandatory injunction may also be granted. To enforce the injunctions granted another section of Indian Penal Code, 1860 attracts attention. It reads “291. Continuance of nuisance after injunction to discontinue. —Whoever repeats or continues a public nuisance, having been enjoined by any public servant who has lawful authority to issue such injunction not to repeat or continue such nuisance, shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine, or with both.”

#### **D3.1.3 _Enforcement_**

Public Nuisance constitutes an offence and the action is taken by or in the name of the State. In respect of criminal action against public nuisance under the Indian Penal Code, 1860, no period of limitation is prescribed.

## **D4 Driving, cycling and other travelling on roads which might endanger pedestrians**

### **D4.1 THE MOTOR VEHICLES ACT, 1988, Rules of Road Regulation 1989 and Indian Penal Code, 1860**

#### **D4.1.1 _Description and Examples_**

The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988[^281] is enacted by the Parliament under the List III of Schedule VII of the Constitution, i.e., Concurrent List, and provides leeway to the provinces to make variations to fine-tune the principles of this law to the local conditions. This law authorizes the modification in the standard vehicles to tailor the circumstances and conditions of PWDs. It also regulates the conduct on the road by laying down traffic norms and also prohibits drunken driving and over-speeding. Besides, the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988[^282] has a relevant provision to award compensation to any victim as a consequence of road accidents.

Interestingly only in section 138 dealing with Rule making power of the Provincial Government the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 refers to the term ‘pedestrian’. Nevertheless following provisions have direct bearing on right to safe and smooth navigation by pedestrians by implication.

Chapter VIII of the Act extensively deals with the ‘control of traffic’.

112\. Limits of speed.

118\. Driving regulations.

119\. Duty to obey traffic signs.

122\. Leaving vehicle in dangerous position.

128\. Safety measures for drivers and pillion riders.

129\. Wearing of protective headgear.

130\. Duty to produce license and certificate of registration.

131\. Duty of the driver to take certain precautions at unguarded railway level crossing.

132\. Duty of driver to stop in certain cases.

133\. Duty of owner of motor vehicle to give information.

134\. Duty of driver in case of accident and injury to a person.

134A. Protection of Good Samaritans.

135\. Schemes to be framed for the investigation of accident cases and wayside

amenities, etc. 136\. Inspection of vehicle involved in accident.

136A. Electronic monitoring and enforcement of road safety.

Further, Chapter IX deals with Insurance of Motor Vehicles Against Third Party Risk,

the relevant sections of the said chapter are;

146\. Necessity for insurance against third party risks

150\. Duty of insurers to satisfy judgments and awards against persons insured in

respect of third-party risks.

151\. Rights of third party against insurers on insolvency of insured.

161\. Special provisions as to compensation in case of hit and run motor accident

164\. Payment of compensation in case of death or grievous hurt, etc.

164A. Scheme for interim relief for claimants.

165.Claims Tribunals.

166\. Application for compensation

180\. Allowing unauthorized persons to drive vehicles

183\. Driving at excessive speed, etc.

184\. Driving dangerously.

185\. Driving by a drunken person or by a person under the influence of drugs.

186\. Driving when mentally or physically unfit to drive.

187\. Punishment for offences relating to accident.

188\. Punishment for abetment of certain offences.

189.Racing and trials of speed.

190\. Using vehicle in unsafe condition.

192\. Using vehicle without registration.

192A. Using vehicle without permit.

196\. Driving uninsured vehicle.

**The Rules of the Road Regulations, 1989[^283]**

In exercise of the powers conferred by Section 118 of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 (59 of 1988), the Central Government has made the Rules of Road Regulation. These rules regulate the driving behaviours. For the purpose of this report, we would focus on Rules having a bearing on rights and safety of pedestrians. Rule 8 pertaining to Caution at road junction, provides that the driver of a motor vehicle shall slow down when  
approaching a road intersection, a road junction, pedestrian crossing, to facilitate road crossing by the pedestrians. Rule 11 deals with Right of way of pedestrians and provides “the pedestrians have the right of way at uncontrolled pedestrian crossing. When any road is provided with footpath or cycle tracks specially for other traffic, except with permission of a police officer in uniform, a driver shall not drive on such footpath or track.” Rule 15 prohibits parking of motor vehicle on a foot-path, or near a traffic light or pedestrian crossing, or away from the edge of the foot path. Additionally, the Rule imposes a general obligation on the driver not to park a motor vehicle on any road in such a way so as to cause danger, obstruction or undue inconvenience to other road. Under Rule 19 the drivers are directed to keep their vehicles within the stipulated light during the observance of stop sign.

**The Indian Penal Code, 1860**

In India, there is also a criminal law to safeguard against negligence, as well as rash and negligent driving on the road[^284]. In case of the death of the pedestrian, Section 304- A of the Indian Penal Code[^285] dealing with Punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder against the accused is invoked. In this connection, Sections 336 to 338 of the Indian Penal Code[^286] are also noteworthy for penalising an act endangering the life or personal safety of others including causing hurt or grievous hurt, which can be invoked by pedestrians with special characteristics.

**Criminal Negligence –** As has been noted, in India, the efficacy of compensation as a remedy is considerably undermined, and the focus is on imposing punishment on the convict guilty of a breach of duty of care. One such example is Section 279 of the Indian Penal Code,1860 which reads “Whoever drives any vehicle, or rides, on any public way in a manner so rash or negligent as to endanger human life, or to be likely to cause hurt or injury to any other person, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees, or with both”.[^287]

In this connection following observation of Delhi High Court is relevant “The pedestrians have a right to walk on the pedestrian way and if there is no pedestrian way, they have a right to walk on the side of the road. All motor vehicles drivers have a duty towards pedestrian and merely because a pedestrian is walking on the side of the road, no motor vehicle driver has a right to hit the pedestrian from behind.”[^288]

In this context, Section 287 of Indian Penal Code is also relevant. It reads “Whoever does, with any machinery, any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life or to be likely to cause hurt or injury to any other person, or knowingly or negligently omits to take such order with any machinery in his possession or under his care as is sufficient to guard against any probable danger to human life from such machinery, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees, or with both.”[^289]

#### **D4.1.2 _Remedies, Sanctions, and Other Outcomes_**

The main remedies under Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 are compensation expiative relief, fine, suspension of permits and imprisonment. Whereas, under common law negligence too, damages can be awarded. Besides, the new 2019 Amendment to The Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 envisages a number of remedial schemes to be framed by the Government viz Golden Hour Scheme[^290] and interim relief scheme for the claimant.[^291] The Central Government is also duty-bound to constitute a Fund to be called the Motor Vehicle Accident Fund inter alia with an objective to (a) treatment of the persons injured in road accidents in accordance with the scheme framed by the Central Government under Section 162; (b) compensation to representatives of a person who died in hit and run motor accident in accordance with schemes framed under Section 161; (c) compensation to a person grievously hurt in a hit and run motor accident in accordance with schemes framed under Section 161; and (d) compensation to such persons as may be prescribed by the Central Government.[^292] The main sanctions under the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 are fine, confiscation of license to drive or motor vehicle, or imprisonment. Even under the Indian Penal Code, 1860, fine and imprisonment is provided. Contributory negligence[^293] or taking reasonable care are two major defenses under the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 and the common law of Tort. Additionally, there is a limitation period of six months under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 to move claims for compensation.[^294]

In respect of discussion on the issue of limitation under the common law of Negligence, see C1.1 (c) Enforcement.

#### **D4.1.3 _Enforcement_**

Under the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, there is a special ‘claims tribunal’[^295] constituted to entertain claims arising from motor vehicle accidents. As regards Common law and criminal law remedy, the jurisdiction of civil and criminal courts can be invoked.

While the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 is a special law providing for rules of traffic regulation and other matters, in cases of injuries arising out of rash and negligent driving, provisions of Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 and the relevant Provisions of Indian Penal Code, 1860 can be invoked together e.g., Section 279 (rash and negligent driving), Sec 304- A (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of Indian Penal Code, 1860 and Section 184 (driving dangerously) of Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 are invoked together in case of death due to negligent driving of the driver. Separate punishments can be imposed by the court subject to proving the required ingredients of each such provision.[^296]

In _Abdul Shaif v. State of Haryana_[^297] the Supreme Court expressed its concern about nonchalant attitude of the drivers, considering the number of vehicular accidents that take place in the country and how such behavior results in lakhs of people losing their life or limbs. The court sought the assistance of Attorney General of India who brought to the notice of the Supreme Court that usage of mobile phones during driving the vehicles is one of the reasons leading to disastrous consequences. A very pertinent point was brought to the notice of the court that such drivers are punished under Section 184 of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988\. However, it was also submitted on being asked by the court, by the Attorney General of India, that the provision of Section 184 is not adequate to handle the situation at present.

For contravention of any of the provisions of Rules of the Road Regulations ,1989 Section 177-A imposes fine which shall not be less than INR 500/-, but may extend to INR 1,000/-

## **D7 Noteworthy project-related observations and concerns**

In India, there is very little awareness about recognizing the rights of the pedestrian over footpaths. As a matter of fact, beyond the Metropolitan cities, footpaths are seldom provided. Even in the capital city of India, parking vehicles on the footpath is not uncommon. We have also observed that in a bid to make the cities smart, footpaths have been redesigned but often in complete or partial ignorance of accessibility norms.

To flag some other issues briefly, there is often a delay in getting medical assistance to pedestrian victims in terms of both first aid and hospital admission. It is also not easy to bring accident claims in absence of proper legal aid and lawyering assistance.

The limitation period of six months from the date of the accident to approach the Claim Tribunals is a very stiff task. Besides, due to legal complications, private medical doctors are very reluctant to provide medical assistance. Moreover, to claim compensation, disability – partial or permanent has to be proved, and for the same, a certificate of disability has to be obtained from the competent authorities. The process of certification being very arduous and long-drawn may consume a lot of time and energy of the victims.

Although third-party insurance of the vehicle is mandatory, this norm is often observed to have been breached. At times, the victim is caught in the cross-fire of disputes between the insurance company and the owner of the motor vehicle.

It is paradoxical that despite numerous judgments of the Supreme Court and High Courts expanding the right to life and recognizing the rights of pedestrians on the footpath and with numerous legislations reiterating the same, it does not reflect in ground realities as there is a yawning gap between the normativity of law and its actual enforcement. To lend credence to this preposition empirically, according to the statistics mentioned in the government report[^298], during the year 2019, a total of 7,749 road accidents that resulted in the death of pedestrians occurred on the National Highways. Out of those 4,957 road accident deaths occurred on the National Highways maintained by the National Highway Authority of India, 2,313 road accident deaths on the National Highways maintained by the State Public Work Department, 479 road accident deaths on the National Highways maintained by other Departments. These figures are staggering and give an idea as to what the plight of the pedestrian on the streets might be. Moreover, the aforementioned study being broadly about pedestrians does not help or assist in assessing the state of pedestrians with protected characteristics. The multiplicity of authorities and a lack of coordination between them compounds the difficulties. The generalized data also does not help the policymakers to capture inputs to have schemes, plans, and initiatives to address the rights of pedestrians with protected characteristics.

In our opinion, the focus of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highway being merely on road accidents, its annual reports do not shed any light on the initiatives vis-à-vis pregnant women, the disabled, and older people facing accidents on streets and roads. Efforts must be made to contextualize the statistics and the fine-grained analysis to have a real idea of the impact of road accidents on pedestrians with protected characteristics. Finally in absence of public duties like sectoral duties under Equality Act of UK, it is most unlikely that public bodies would bring legal actions for vindication of rights of pedestrians even though National Human Rights Commission or Office of Chief Commissioner of Disabilities have the mandate to bring legal action against government it is unlikely that as appointees of the government they would confront the same.

# **E Cross-cutting issues**

## **E1 Key Topical Issues**

There are following key topical issues.

Absence of physical and mental disability as a ground of non-discrimination in Constitution of India, 1950\. In India, Constitution being the grund norm it is the highest fountain of the powers and responsibilities of government. Explicit omission of physical and mental disability as ground of non-discrimination and its mention to depict incompetence perpetuates ableism. Enactment of legislations like RPWD Act, 2016 till perceived as super statutes their impact is bound to be blunt on legal consciousness in particular and constitutional culture in general. Mere entertainment of the perception that disability-based discrimination amount to inequality has the potential to cause a sea change in the decision-making process of the administration and therefore the need of the hour is to embrace diversity and respect for difference as a part of foundational value of public law of India.

Endurance of ableism by perpetuating stereotypes on the basis of notions such as ‘unsoundness of mind’, ‘physical incapacity’ etc. is endemic to legal order and for combating the same urgent intervention on the part of civil society and the government is the order of the day.

Indifference to invocation of international standards like Washington questions while collecting and processing data. disability community and the experts view with suspicion the census data about PWDs in India.[^299] it is also observed that the classification of disabilities is prone to medical model at least till the census of 2011\. The same is evident from the classification of disabilities adopted by the census i.e. In Seeing, In Hearing, In Speech, In Movement, Mental retardation, Mental Illness, Multiple Disability and Others.[^300] There is very little information available about Census 2021 in respect of the disabled population in India. There is a close connection between absence of disabled desegregated data and earmark financial resources in the budget of both Central and Provincial Governments. Critics have demonstrated continuous reduction of budget in respect of disability since last four years.[^301] Both in its initial report and concluding observations CRPD committee has raised concerns about regressive definition of discrimination under RPWD Act, 2016 in Section 3(3). We have already demonstrated the extraordinary degree of under implementation of RPWD Act, 2016 both in terms of establishing machinery and achieving targets. Provincial Governments keep on extending the deadlines of targets in respect of accessibility of public buildings and allied spaces. Beyond big cities accessibility is still not a very big issue and the same is the case with foot paths in rural areas.

Below we highlight additional noticeable problems faced by PWDs and older people. Like most of the post-colonial countries, India being one of them, we have issues with effective mechanism for the enforcement. One of the main reasons why PWDs or older people do not get effective redressal is the lack of adequate presentation in the decision-making process during the enactment of laws. Since the redressal mechanism is multi-axis in nature, there is often a problem of a lack of coordination between them. The powers of the most of the Commissions are recommendatory in nature, and so, they lack bite. Even the timelines set in the legislation like the RPWD Act, 2016 are generally interpreted by courts to be directory and aspirational, thereby lacking effective sanctions for non-compliance. In India, courts do not usually award costs and therefore, it is no incentive in moving the court. However, the problem with Indian courts is the slow pace with which they work and the lack of sensitization of judges about the rights of PWDs.

In terms of mobility and access, it is not easy for PWDs to move either High Court or the Supreme Court easily, as they are located in the capital cities or at far-away places. Moreover, for conducting litigation, resources are required, and therefore, unless lawyers offer their services pro-bono it is difficult to go for litigation. At times, due to the lack of awareness and legal illiteracy, the PWDs are not in a position to avail the benefits provided by the Government. The typical adversarial process during litigation or normal administrative complaints creates disincentives for PWDs and older people to go for redressal as they often face the very hostile and neutral attitude of officials.

The appointment of the Commissioners at both the Central and State Levels are very irregular and their status differs province-wise. Some provinces appoint a disability rights activist as a commissioner whereas others simply appoint a bureaucrat without any experience in the field. The same results in a disconnect between the disability community and the office of the Commissioner. By way of an example, the case of Eera Through Dr. Manjula Krippendorf v. State (NCT of Delhi) and Another[^302] is relevant**,** when a mother wanted the criminal prosecution of a rapist on behest of a daughter suffering from Cerebral Palsy whose mental age was of 4 to 5 years, whereas her biological age was more than 18 years, she did not get adequate support from the Supreme Court. Interestingly, the Supreme Court appointed an Amicus Curie to represent the accused who had died but did not explore the possibility of invocation of the POCSO Act against the rapist by taking into account the mental age, and not the biological age of the victim. The court decided to treat the girl as an adult and refused to accept the contention of her mother about ‘age-specific reasonable accommodation’ to the girl.

At this place it is also necessary on evolution of disability sensitive Tort law. Ideas of respect for difference and disability as part of human diversity must be incorporated as part of the substratum of law of Tort. Physical and mental disability being subject matter in List II, where Provinces can make laws and also empowering the third tier of the Government to intervene for the empowerment of the PWDs it is high time to simply look at RPWD Act, 2016 as a sole panacea both the provincial and local authorities must take cognizance of the physical and mental disability as a main stream issue and anchor their policies accordingly. Sensitization of the Parliamentarians, bureaucrats and the judges is another important issue deserving focus.

Finally, the key to empowerment of PWDs lies in taking steps to enable them to deliver their capacities as productive units of the society.

## **E2 Strengths and Good Practices**

With the evolution of PWD Act, 1995 community of the PWDs has increasingly asserted itself against injustice both in political and judicial spheres. In political sphere the impact of agitation is very evident with the enactment of RPWD Act, 2016\. In a country with a population of 130 million comprehensive revision of law within a space of 21 years is by no means a small achievement. India’s involvement right from the evolution to the entry into force of UNCRPD is noteworthy and exemplary. It became one of the first countries to not only sign but also ratify the convention categorically. India has also played a key role in rolling out and implementation of Incheon Strategy. Supreme Court and High Court have also reminded time and again, the Governments at all level their responsibilities towards PWDs. Of let the Supreme Court has invoked the principle of intersectionality and reasonable accommodation to provide new lease of life to disability rights jurisprudence evidenced by Vikash Kumar v. Union Public Service Commission and Ors,[^303] and Patan Jamal Vali and State of Andhra Pradesh.[^304] Justice D Y Chandrachud has strongly advocated for the judicial cognizance of distinct social identity of PWDs there by attaching value to their experience and vulnerability. He has called for adoption of intersectionality in preference to single access investigation of discrimination to equip judiciary to go for contextual interpretation of law.

The Department of Empowerment of persons with disability at national level is playing a focal role in rolling out new schemes, programs and initiative for rehabilitation of PWDs. The Department is also very active in liaising with all other ministries to mainstream disability in every aspect of governance.

Normatively even the mechanism of chief commissioner of office of PWDs, State Commissioner and Central and provincial advisory boards are lynch pins. However, in reality they lack motivation. Disability community itself has become very agile and informed about their rights and their responsibilities though the spillover effect of the same in rural areas is yet to be seen e.g. whether or not India must adopt Washington questions while collecting and processing data is a matter of vocal discussion amongst the advocacy groups of disability community. National Census of India has also shown considerable sensitivity during the Census of 2011 while going for the count of the population of India and we hope that there will be considerable improvements in its performance during 2021 census.

## **E3 Weaknesses and Concerns**

Taking about weaknesses and concerns firstly due to lack of resources it is extremely difficult for PWDs to resort to litigation for vindication of their personal rights. They have to totally depend on NGOs or Public-spirited individuals to take up their cause to the courts. Vitally every cause of PWDs being incapable of characterized as part of public interest the same cannot be taken up through Public Interest Litigation. The need of the hour is to eliminate the barriers in all the process of access to justice.

Secondly, there is acute problem of non-enforcement and lack of implementation of the normative structure both under Constitution of India 1950 and RPWD Act, 2016\.

Thirdly right to accessibility being a very new in the vocabulary of Indian legal order its scope is by and large confined to ramps and accessible infrastructure. There are very few judgments linking right to freedom of movement with accessibility. To put briefly the whole chapter of fundamental rights under part III of the Constitution though may entrenched vis-à-vis able bodied to transmit the entrenchment in respect of PWDs creation of rights enabling conditions environment has to be emphasized.

Fourthly, it is impossible to exhaust rights of PWDs in a single legislation nor is it appropriate to characterize this issue worthy of addressing through special/ enabling provisions for adherence of letter and spirit of UNCRPD. Adoption of twin track approach is the right call under the same apart from having certain special legislations addressing those aspects of disabilities which are usually beyond main stream. By way of first track all the legislations including Constitution of India 1950 must be informed and be sensitive to the values of respect for the difference and disability as part of human diversity. Since RPWD Act, 2016 depends on the machinery of other legislations for the full and effective realization of the objective underlying it the strengthening of first track is all the important. As has been aptly provided the inclusion of PWDs in all walks of life be both intentional and deliberate though their exclusion may not. To achieve this objective, we do not have enough programs to sensitize judges, legislatures, ministers and bureaucrats about the potential and productivity of the PWDs. Absence of body like national access board makes it very difficult both to evolve standards of accessibility and to initiate schemes and programs for making the streets and roads accessible for PWDs. Disability should not be perceived merely as an international issue under the arch of UNCRPD, every state has to play a vital role in redressing and addressing its local dimensions at its level. Presently our focus is mostly on UNCRPD or RPWD Act, 2016\. There is hardly any pressure on the states to come out with appropriate legislation and policies for the empowerment of PWDs. There is also a very serious problem of almost total lack of access to the office of State Commissioner to PWDs residing in rural areas or in districts far away from Pune the inaccessible and out of date web-site of commissioner compounds the difficulty further. The Committees at District Level as envisage by RPWD Act, 2016 seem to be inactive and more or less the same is the case with advisory board and the sate executive committee. In short, the law looks effective only on paper. Inter alia the solution lies in gearing up of movement by PWDs as well as by the civil society.

## **E4 Recommendations**

Firstly, to ensure effective representation to PWDs in every layer of decision-making process, in this connection attention is invited to Article 243 D- 6 of the Constitution of India, 1950 empowering the provinces to provide reservations in seats of ward member in Panchayats and Municipalities to backward of class of citizens. In our submission people with disabilities do represent the same.

Secondly it is high time to recognize physical and mental disabilities as one of the grounds of non-discrimination in Article 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India.

Thirdly, at par with Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe and economically weaker sections PWDs must also be represented in the Constitution of India with the evolution of appropriate machinery particularly we would suggest creation of a Constitutional Commission for the empowerment of PWDs and at par with the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes. We would seek mandatory obligation on the centre and the provinces to periodically revise and notify the list of PWDs in a disability desegregated manner. We would seek an amendment in the fundamental duties obligating the nation and the people to nurture respect for difference and embrace disability as a part of human diversity. Similar amendment would be sought in list II of the Schedule 7 of the Constitution read with Article 246 and Directive Principle of State Policy. Particularly we would insist on having a relook on matrices and the dynamics of Article 41 and 46\. In this context observations of one of us in an unpublished article are worth citing “Compounding the same, the constitutional topography of India very awkwardly sandwiches entry 9 list 2 ‘Relief of the disabled and unemployable’ between entry 8 ‘Intoxicating liquors….’ and entry 10 ‘Burials and burial grounds; cremations and cremation grounds.’ The constitutional placement of disability in such an indifferent and insensitive manner speaks volumes about the blunt State consciousness about the disabled in particular and vulnerable sections of the society in general.

Equally, it has to be noted that the word ‘disabled’ is prefixed by ‘relief of’ and suffixed by ‘unemployable’ thereby demonstrating very little room for legislative maneuvering. In a way, the word ‘disabled’ is again sandwiched between relief and unemployable as if only for providing relief and to address unemployment the legislature is obligated to make laws. This argument is justified by the language of Article 41 of Directive Principle of State Policy, which reads ‘The State shall, within the limits of its economic capacity and development, make effective provision for securing the right to work, to education and to public assistance in cases of unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement, and in other cases of undeserved want.’ This article is a textbook example of how Constitutions are confluenced by ableism. In a very ambivalent and condescending tone, the disablement is stationed in the Constitution alongside unemployment, old age, and sickness and on the other hand, while mandating the state to make effective provisions for securing the right to work, to education and to public assistance, the obligation is watered down by giving a long rope through the conditionality, ‘within the limits of its economic capacity and development.’

With the backing of the word ‘shall’, the rope becomes extremely strong. A careful reading of this article alongside entry 9 list 2 very glaringly establishes that the Constitution of India has conferred less than second class citizenship status on the PWDs. Categorically, the text of the Constitution continues to perpetuate an abhorrent and embarrassing idea that PWDs deserve certain rights only if affordable to the State. The flip side of this proposition is that only affordable claims brought by PWDs on the ground of disability-based discrimination should be entertained. To contrast the constitutional indifference and neutrality towards PWDs to that of SCs and STs, Article 46, Directive Principles of State Policy is worth reading “The State shall promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people, and, in particular, of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, and shall protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation.” There are stark differences between these 2 articles. Unlike the former, the latter is not subject to the limits of economic capacity and development of the State, nor does it sound paternalistic.

On the other hand, the former, apart from being subject to the conditionality of limits of economic capacity and development of the State, treats disablement as the lowest priority by even insulating the same from the weaker sections of people as if the Constitution aspires to recognize disablement as a sue generis category. To justify this argument, there is intrinsic evidence in the language of Article 46 recognizing a category of ‘weaker sections of the people’ and excluding from its scope disablement with its explicit omission and recognizing SCs and STs as its constituents by its emphatic mention of the same therein. The preamble of the Constitution of India employs the expression ‘We the people’ and Article 46 slightly modifies it by laying down weaker sections of the people. If the word ‘people’ in the preamble were to be inclusive, then is it not possible to critique the exclusion of disablement or disability from the resembling expression ‘weaker section of the people’ under Article 46 is a moot question. It is interesting to note that although both the articles operate on an aspirational plane as part of Constitutional ethics, the exclusionary nature of Article 46 and the condescending tone of Article 41 results in a strange constitutional paradox trading off priority of the disabled with weaker sections of the people.”[^305] The Right to accessibility must be recognized as one of the fundamental rights. Suitable amendment must be in Article 14 to explicitly recognize ‘reasonable accommodation’ as a part of equal protection of laws. Under Article 15 (2) of Constitution of India, 1950 the word ‘access’ must be interpreted in light of disability right jurisprudence so as to enforce right to accessibility even against private parties and some parts of private sectors. Since right to accessibility is a hybrid of civil and political and socio-economic rights, Central government and all provinces must be obligated to create an accessibility redressal fund and every year budgets of both must ear-marked specified sum in the same.

[^153]: It is not easy to define executive power however Supreme Court of India held in _Rai Saheb Ram Jawaya Kapoor v State of Punjab_ (AIR 1955 SC 549\) that residuary powers after providing legislative powers to the Parliament and judicial powers to the judiciary are characterised as executive power. Executive power in plain language means power to implement/ execute. Generally, executive power has to be exercised against the backdrop of the legislation. However, in certain exceptional cases in absence of any legislation covering sphere of life, executive power may be exercised exclusively. In UK, the same is popularly known as prerogative power.

    Working draft of Right of Persons with Disabilities Bill 2011 was more explicit in defining ‘discrimination’ to cover both direct and indirect discrimination. There was also reference to multiple discrimination: ‘(i) Discrimination on the basis of ‘Prohibited Grounds’ means discrimination on the grounds of:(i) Disability (ii) Perceived disability, whether the perception is accurate or otherwise, or (iii) Association of a person with persons to whom one or more prohibited grounds apply, or (iv) A combination of disability and any other ground such as religion, race, caste, tribe, place of birth, age, language, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy, maternity, marital status, care giver status, economic status, political or other opinion.’

[^250]: But see D.K. Basu vs. State of West Bengal (18.12.1996 \- SC): MANU/SC/0157/1997. Para 42 “Article 9(5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966 (ICCPR) provides that ‘anyone who has been the victim of unlawful arrest or detention shall have enforceable right to compensation’. Of course, the Government of India at the time of its ratification (of ICCPR) in 1979 had made a specific reservation to the effect that the Indian Legal system does not recognise a right to compensation for victims of unlawful arrest or detention and thus did not become a party to the Covenant. That reservation, however, has now lost its relevance in view of the law laid down by this Court in a number of cases awarding compensation for the infringement of the fundamental right to life of a citizen. See with advantage Rudal Shah v. State of Bihar MANU/SC/0380/1983:1983CriLJ1644; Sebastian M. Hongrey v. Union of India MANU/SC/0163/1984: \[1984\]3SCR22; Bhim Singh v. State of J and K MANU/SC/0064/1985 :1986CriLJ192 and Saheli v. Commissioner of Police, Delhi MANU/SC/0478/1989: AIR1990SC513.There is indeed no express provision in the Constitution of India for grant of compensation for violation of a fundamental right to life, nonetheless, this Court has judicially evolved a right to compensation in cases of established unconstitutional deprivation of personal liberty or life.”
